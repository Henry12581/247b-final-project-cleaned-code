Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
Response:
$18.00 * 8 = $144.00 (regular pay)
$18.00 + ($18.00 / 2) = $27.00 (overtime rate)
$27.00 * 2 = $54.00 (overtime pay per hour)
10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours of overtime
2 hours * $54.00/hour = $108.00 (overtime pay)
Total daily pay: $144.00 + $108.00 = $252.00
5 days * $252.00/day
