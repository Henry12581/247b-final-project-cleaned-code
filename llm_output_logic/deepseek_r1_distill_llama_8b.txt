=== Problem 61 ===
Prompt:
A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?
Response:
<think>
First, I need to determine how many people were on the ship during the first 100 years.

Each century, the number of people doubles because ships have been built larger over time. This means the number of people triples every 200 years (since doubling for two centuries results in tripling).

Given that the monster has eaten a total of 847 people over 300 years, I can set up an equation to find the initial number of people on the first ship.

Let \( x \) represent the number of people on the first ship. After three centuries, the number of people eaten would be \( x + 2x + 4x = 7x \).

Setting up the equation:
\[ 7x = 847 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{847}{7} = 121 \]

Therefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- A deep-sea monster rises from the waters every **100 years** and eats a ship.
- Over **300 years**, the monster has consumed a total of **847 people**.
- Each new ship built is twice as large as the previous one, meaning the number of people on each subsequent ship doubles.

**Let’s denote:**
- \( x \) = Number of people on the first ship (the one eaten in the first 100 years).

**Understanding the Pattern:**
Since each ship has twice as many people as the last, the number of people triples every **200 years**:
- First century: \( x \)
- Second century: \( 2x \)
- Third century: \( 4x \)

**Total People Eaten Over 300 Years:**
\[
x + 2x + 4x = 7x
\]
Given that the total is **847 people**:
\[
7x = 847
\]

**Solving for \( x \):**
\[
x = \frac{847}{7} = 121
\]

Prompt:
Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?
Response:
<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of pizza slices Albert purchased.

There are 2 large pizzas, each with 16 slices, so that's 2 multiplied by 16, which equals 32 slices from the large pizzas.

Additionally, there are 2 small pizzas, each with 8 slices, contributing 2 times 8, totaling 16 slices from the small pizzas.

Next, I'll add the slices together to find the total number of pizza slices Albert has: 32 slices plus 16 slices equals 48 slices in total.

Finally, since Albert eats all the pizza he bought, he will consume all 48 slices.
</think>

**Solution:**

Albert buys:
- **2 large pizzas**, each with **16 slices**
- **2 small pizzas**, each with **8 slices**

Let's calculate the total number of pizza slices:

1. **Calculate the total slices from large pizzas:**
   \[
   2 \text{ large pizzas} \times 16 \text{ slices/pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total slices from small pizzas:**
   \[
   2 \text{ small pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 16 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Add both amounts to find the total number of pizza slices eaten:**
   \[
   32 \text{ slices (large)} + 16 \text{ slices (small)} = 48 \text{ slices}

Prompt:
Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
Response:
<think>
To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, I'll start by calculating the total amount she spent on the other items.

She bought:
- Button-up shirt: \$30
- Suit pants: \$46
- Suit coat: \$38
- Socks: \$11
- Belt: \$18

Adding these together: 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = \$143.

Alexis has a total budget of \$200 and spent \$143 on the above items. Subtracting this from her budget gives her remaining money for the shoes: 200 - 143 = \$57.

She also had \$16 left after purchasing the shoes, so I'll set up an equation to find the cost of the shoes:
57 - Shoes = 16
Solving for Shoes: Shoes = 57 - 16 = \$41.

Therefore, Alexis paid \$41 for the shoes.
</think>

To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, let's break down her purchases and remaining budget step by step.

1. **Total Budget:**  
   Alexis started with a budget of **\$200**.

2. **Amount Spent on Other Items:**  
   - Button-up shirt: \$30
   - Suit pants: \$46
   - Suit coat: \$38
   - Socks: \$11
   - Belt: \$18

   **Total spent on these items:**  
   \[
   30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = \$143
   \]

3. **Remaining Budget After Purchases:**  
   Alexis has **\$16** left after buying the above items.

4. **Calculating the Cost of Shoes:**  
   The remaining money is used for the shoes and any other possible purchases. However, since she only mentions purchasing a pair of shoes, we can assume that the entire remaining amount was spent on them.

   \[
   \$16 = \text{Cost of Shoes}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**  
   Alexis paid **\$16** for the shoes.

Prompt:
Ann's favorite store was having a summer clearance. For $75 she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. How much did each top cost?
Response:
<think>
To determine how much each top costs, I'll start by calculating the total amount Ann spent on her purchases.

First, calculate the cost of the shorts:
5 pairs × \$7 per pair = \$35

Next, calculate the cost of the shoes:
2 pairs × \$10 per pair = \$20

Then, add these amounts together to find the total for clothing items:
\$35 (shorts) + \$20 (shoes) = \$55

Ann also bought 4 tops. Let \( x \) represent the cost of each top.

The equation representing the total cost is:
4x = \$55

To find the value of \( x \), divide both sides by 4:
x = \$55 / 4
x = \$13.75

Therefore, each top costs Ann \$13.75.
</think>

Let's determine how much each top costs.

**Given:**
- **Shorts:** 5 pairs at \$7 each
- **Shoes:** 2 pairs at \$10 each
- **Tops:** 4 pieces at the same price per top

**Step 1:** Calculate the total cost of the shorts.
\[
5 \text{ pairs} \times \$7/\text{pair} = \$35
\]

**Step 2:** Calculate the total cost of the shoes.
\[
2 \text{ pairs} \times \$10/\text{pair} = \$20
\]

**Step 3:** Find the combined total for clothing items.
\[
\$35 (\text{shorts}) + \$20 (\text{shoes}) = \$55
\]

**Step 4:** Let \( x \) be the cost of one top. Since there are 4 tops:
\[
4x = \$55
\]

**Step 5:** Solve for \( x \).
\[
x = \frac{\$55}{4} = \$13.75
\]

**Final Answer:**
Each top costs \(\boxed{13.75}\

Prompt:
Brennan was researching his school project and had to download files from the internet to his computer to use for reference. After downloading 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. How many valuable files was he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round?
Response:
<think>
First, Brennan downloads 800 files.

He deletes 70% of these, which is 560 files, leaving him with 240 valuable files.

Next, he downloads an additional 400 files.

Out of these, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are irrelevant, amounting to 240 files. Therefore, 160 files are considered valuable.

Finally, by adding the second set's valuable files to the initial ones, Brennan has a total of 500 valuable files.
</think>

Let's break down Brennan's file management step by step:

1. **First Download:**
   - **Total Files Downloaded:** 800
   - **Files Deleted (70%):** \( 0.7 \times 800 = 560 \)
   - **Valuable Files Remaining:** \( 800 - 560 = 240 \)

2. **Second Download:**
   - **Additional Files Downloaded:** 400
   - **Irrelevant Files (3/5 of the second download):** \( \frac{3}{5} \times 400 = 240 \)
   - **Valuable Files from Second Download:** \( 400 - 240 = 160 \)

3. **Total Valuable Files:**
   - **Initial Valuable Files:** 240
   - **New Valuable Files:** 160
   - **Combined Total:** \( 240 + 160 = 400 \)

However, upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an error in determining the final total. Let's correct that:

- **Correct Calculation:**
  - **First Download Remaining:** 240
  - **Second Download Valuable Files:** 160
  - **Total Valuable Files After Both Downloads:** \( 240 + 160 = 400 \)

Prompt:
Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?
Response:
<think>
To determine how many beetles are eaten each day by the animals in the forest, I'll start by analyzing the given information.

First, each bird consumes 12 beetles daily. There are no birds mentioned in this scenario, so the total number of beetles eaten by birds is 0.

Next, each snake eats 3 birds per day. However, since there are no birds present, snakes also do not contribute to the consumption of beetles.

Finally, each jaguar consumes 5 snakes per day. With 6 jaguars in the forest, the total number of snakes eaten by all jaguars is 6 multiplied by 5, which equals 30 snakes per day.

Since there are no snakes available for the jaguars to eat, this means that the number of beetles consumed remains unchanged at 0.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Birds' Consumption:**
   - Each bird eats **12 beetles** per day.
   - However, there are no birds mentioned in the scenario.

2. **Snakes' Consumption:**
   - Each snake eats **3 birds** per day.
   - Since there are no birds available, snakes do not contribute to beetle consumption.

3. **Jaguars' Consumption:**
   - Each jaguar eats **5 snakes** per day.
   - With **6 jaguars** in the forest:
     \[
     6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/day/jaguar} = 30 \text{ snakes/day}
     \]
   - Since there are no snakes available, this means that the number of beetles consumed remains unchanged.

4. **Total Beetles Eaten:**
   - Birds: \(0\)
   - Snakes: \(0\)
   - Jaguars: \(0\) (since they don't have any snakes to eat)

Prompt:
In a truck, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats.  If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.
Response:
<think>
First, I identify the initial quantities of each colored hard hat: 26 pink, 15 green, and 24 yellow.

Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats. This reduces the pink count to 22.

John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as Carl removed. Since Carl took 4 pink hats, John takes 2 × 4 = 8 green hats. This leaves 15 - 8 = 7 green hats remaining.

The number of yellow hard hats remains unchanged at 24.

Finally, I calculate the total number of hard hats left by adding the remaining quantities: 22 pink + 7 green + 24 yellow = 53 hard hats.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Initial Counts:**
- **Pink Hard Hats:** 26
- **Green Hard Hats:** 15
- **Yellow Hard Hats:** 24

**Carl Takes Away:**
- **Pink Hard Hats:** 4
  - Remaining Pink Hard Hats = 26 - 4 = **22**

**John Takes Away:**
- **Pink Hard Hats:** 6
  - Remaining Pink Hard Hats = 22 - 6 = **16**
  
- **Green Hard Hats:** Twice the number of pink hard hats Carl took.
  - John takes \(2 \times 4 = 8\) green hard hats.
  - Remaining Green Hard Hats = 15 - 8 = **7**

**Yellow Hard Hats Remain Unchanged:**
- **Remaining Yellow Hard Hats:** 24

Prompt:
Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?
Response:
<think>
To determine how much salt Jack will have after the water evaporates, I'll start by calculating the amount of salt initially present in the 2 liters of seawater.

Given that the seawater is 20% salt, I can find the volume of salt by multiplying the total volume of water by the salt concentration:

Salt = 20% of 2 liters = 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 liters.

Since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter, I'll convert this to milliliters:

0.4 liters = 400 milliliters.

Next, I'll consider the process of water evaporation. When Jack leaves the bucket in the sun, some of the water will evaporate. However, the salt remains behind because it is not soluble in vapor and does not evaporate with the water.

Therefore, regardless of how much water evaporates, the amount of salt that Jack collects will remain at 400 milliliters.
</think>

**Solution:**

Jack wants to collect salt from seawater to season his fish. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how he can achieve this:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **Volume of Seawater Collected:** 2 liters
   - **Salt Concentration in Seawater:** 20%

2. **Calculating the Amount of Salt:**
   - **Total Salt in 2 Liters:** 
     \[
     \text{Salt} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Volume} = 20\% \times 2 \text{ liters}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Salt} = 0.2 \times 2 = 0.4 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - **Convert Liters to Milliliters (since 1 liter = 1000 milliliters):**
     \[
     0.4 \text{ liters} = 400 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Evaporation Process:**
   - When water evaporates, the salt remains behind because it is not volatile and does not turn into vapor.
   - Therefore, **all the salt initially present in the seawater will remain after evaporation**.

4. **Final Amount of Salt Jack Collects:**
   \[
   \text{Salt Collected} = 400 \text{ milliliters}

Prompt:
Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?
Response:
<think>
First, I need to determine the total amount Jasper spends on the ingredients by calculating each item's cost separately.

Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. This means the cost per pound of cheddar cheese is $5.

Next, he purchases a pound of cream cheese that costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Therefore, the cream cheese costs $2.50.

Then, there's a pack of cold cuts that costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Since the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, the cold cuts cost $20.

Finally, I'll add up all the costs: $10 for cheddar cheese, $2.50 for cream cheese, and $20 for cold cuts, which totals $32.50.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for \$10.
   - Cost per pound of cheddar cheese = \$10 / 2 = \$5 per pound.

2. **Cream Cheese:**
   - The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese.
   - Price of cream cheese = (1/2) × \$5 = \$2.50.

Prompt:
Joy can read 8 pages of a book in 20 minutes. How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?
Response:
<think>
To determine how long Joy will take to read 120 pages, I'll start by calculating her reading rate.

First, Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find her reading speed per minute, I divide the number of pages by the time: 8 pages / 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute.

Next, I'll calculate how long it takes to read 120 pages by dividing the total pages by her reading rate: 120 pages / 0.4 pages per minute = 300 minutes.

Finally, I'll convert the total minutes into hours by dividing by 60: 300 minutes ÷ 60 = 5 hours.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Joy's Reading Rate:**
   
   Joy reads **8 pages** in **20 minutes**.
   
   \[
   \text{Reading Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Pages}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{8\, \text{pages}}{20\, \text{minutes}} = 0.4\, \text{pages per minute}
   \]

2. **Calculate Time to Read 120 Pages:**
   
   Using the reading rate:
   
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of Pages}}{\text{Reading Rate}} = \frac{120\, \text{pages}}{0.4\, \text{pages per minute}} = 300\, \text{minutes}
   \]
   
3. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   
   \[
   300\, \text{minutes} ÷ 60 = 5\, \text{hours}

Prompt:
Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?
Response:
<think>
To determine the final weight of the box, I'll break down each step Ken took.

First, Ken poured jelly beans into the box until it weighed 2 pounds.

Next, he added brownies, which caused the total weight to triple. Tripling 2 pounds gives a weight of 6 pounds at this stage.

Then, Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. Adding these brings the total weight up to 8 pounds.

Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Doubling 8 pounds results in a final weight of 16 pounds.

Prompt:
Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?
Response:
<think>
First, I identify the number of yellow flowers, which is given as 10.

Next, I calculate the number of purple flowers by finding 80% more than the yellow ones: 10 + (0.8 * 10) = 18 purple flowers.

Then, I determine the total number of yellow and purple flowers combined: 10 + 18 = 28.

Since there are only 25% as many green flowers as the sum of yellow and purple flowers, I calculate 25% of 28 to find the number of green flowers: 0.25 * 28 = 7 green flowers.

Finally, I add up all the flowers to get the total number in Mark's garden: 10 + 18 + 7 = 35.

=== Problem 80 ===
Prompt:
Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?
Response:
<think>
To determine Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income, I'll start by defining the unknown variable.

Let \( x \) represent her previous monthly income.

Initially, she spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities. This can be expressed as:
\[
0.40x = \text{Rent and Utilities}
\]

After her salary increase, her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of her new income. Her new salary is \( x + \$600 \), so the expense becomes:
\[
0.25(x + 600) = \text{Rent and Utilities}
\]

Since both expressions represent the same expense, I can set them equal to each other:
\[
0.40x = 0.25(x + 600)
\]

Expanding the right side:
\[
0.40x = 0.25x + 150
\]

Subtracting \( 0.25x \) from both sides gives:
\[
0.15x = 150
\]

Finally, solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{150}{0.15} = 1000
\]
</think>

To determine Mrs. Snyder's **previous monthly income**, let's follow these steps:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be her **previous monthly income**.

2. **Initial Expenditure on Rent and Utilities:**
   - She spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities.
   \[
   \text{Rent and Utilities} = 0.40x
   \]

3. **After Salary Increase:**
   - Her salary increased by \$600, so her new monthly income is \( x + 600 \).
   - Now, rent and utilities amount to 25% of her new income.
   \[
   \text{Rent and Utilities} = 0.25(x + 600)
   \]

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Since both expressions represent the same expense:
   \[
   0.40x = 0.25(x + 600)
   \]
   
5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   0.40x = 0.25x + 150
   \]
   Subtract \( 0.25x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0.15x = 150
   \]
   Divide both sides by 0.15:
   \[
   x = \frac{150}{0.15} = 1000

Prompt:
Ralph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?
Response:
<think>
First, I need to determine the total number of tennis balls Ralph attempted to hit.

He starts with 175 balls. Out of the first 100 balls, he hits \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them. Calculating this gives:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \text{ balls}
\]
So, he missed \( 100 - 40 = 60 \) balls in the first set.

Next, for the remaining 75 balls, he hits \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25 \text{ balls}
\]
This means he missed \( 75 - 25 = 50 \) balls in the second set.

Adding up all the missed balls from both sets:
\[
60 + 50 = 110
\]
Therefore, Ralph did not hit a total of 110 tennis balls.
</think>

Let's determine how many tennis balls Ralph did **not** hit by breaking down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Balls Loaded:**
   \[
   175 \text{ tennis balls}

     \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - **Not Hit:** 
     \[

Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
Response:
<think>
First, I need to determine how many letters are in Jamie's last name. Jamie's last name is "Grey," which has 5 letters.

Next, according to the problem, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, it would be twice the length of Jamie's last name. This means Bobbie's original last name must have been twice 5 plus 2, totaling 12 letters.

Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. Therefore, Samantha's last name is 12 minus 3, which equals 9 letters.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many letters are in Samantha's last name.

1. **Jamie's Last Name:**
   - Jamie's full name is **Jamie Grey**.
   - The last name is **Grey**, which has **5 letters**.

2. **Bobbie's Last Name Adjustment:**
   - If Bobbie took **two letters off her last name**, the length of her last name would be **twice the length of Jamie’s last name**.
   - Let \( L \) represent the original number of letters in Bobbie's last name.
   - After removing two letters, the length becomes \( L - 2 = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L - 2 = 10 \\
     L = 12
     \]
   - So, Bobbie's original last name has **12 letters**.

3. **Samantha's Last Name:**
   - Samantha’s last name has **three fewer letters** than Bobbie’s last name.
   - Therefore, the number of letters in Samantha's last name is:

Prompt:
The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
Response:
<think>
First, I need to determine the total profit from the business transaction based on the given ratio of 2:5 between Mike and Johnson.

Next, using the total ratio (2 + 5 = 7 parts), each part is equal to $2500 divided by 7, which is approximately $357.14.

Then, I'll calculate Mike's share by multiplying his ratio by the value of one part: 2 * $357.14 = $714.28.

After that, I'll subtract the cost of the shirt from Mike's share: $714.28 - $200 = $514.28.

Finally, Johnson's share remains unchanged at $2500.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Total Profit Based on the Ratio:**
   
   The profit is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio of 2:5.
   
   \[
   \text{Total parts} = 2 + 5 = 7
   \]
   
   Let each part be equal to \( x \). Therefore:
   
   \[
   2x + 5x = 7x = \text{Total Profit}
   \]
   
   Given that Johnson received \$2500, which corresponds to 5 parts:
   
   \[
   5x = \$2500 \\
   x = \frac{\$2500}{5} = \$500
   \]
   
   So, the total profit is:
   
   \[
   7x = 7 \times \$500 = \$3500
   \]

2. **Calculate Mike's Share:**
   
   Mike's share corresponds to 2 parts:
   
   \[
   \text{Mike's share} = 2 \times x = 2 \times \$500 = \$1000
   \]
   
3. **Deduct the Cost of the Shirt from Mike's Share:**
   
   Mike spent \$200 on a shirt.
   
   \[
   \text{Mike's remaining amount} = \$1000 - \$200 = \$800
   \]

There are 5 houses on a street, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden. If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?
Response:
<think>
To determine how many gnomes are at the fifth house, I start by calculating the total number of gnomes at the first four houses.

Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, so there are 4 houses multiplied by 3 gnomes per house, which equals 12 gnomes.

Given that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, I subtract the number of gnomes at the first four houses from the total to find out how many gnomes are at the fifth house.

20 total gnomes minus 12 gnomes equals 8 gnomes at the fifth house.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- There are **5 houses** on a street.
- Each of the **first four houses** has **3 gnomes** in their garden.
- The total number of gnomes on the entire street is **20**.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of gnomes at the first four houses.

\[
\text{Gnomes at first four houses} = \text{Number of houses} \times \text{Gnomes per house}
\]
\[
= 4 \times 3
\]
\[
= 12
\]

**Step 2:** Determine the number of gnomes at the fifth house.

Let \( x \) be the number of gnomes at the fifth house. According to the problem, the total number of gnomes is 20. Therefore:

\[
\text{Gnomes at first four houses} + \text{Gnomes at fifth house} = 20
\]
\[
12 + x = 20
\]

**Step 3:** Solve for \( x \).

\[
x = 20 - 12

Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?
Response:
<think>
To determine the total time Tim spends biking in a week, I'll break down his activities into workdays and weekends.

First, during his five workdays, Tim commutes to work each day. The distance to work is 20 miles, and he bikes at 25 mph. So, the time spent on each workday commute is 20 miles divided by 25 mph, which equals 0.8 hours per day. Over five days, this amounts to 4 hours.

Next, Tim goes for a weekend bike ride that's 200 miles long. To find out how long this ride takes, I'll divide the total distance by his biking speed: 200 miles divided by 25 mph, resulting in 8 hours.

Finally, adding both the workday commutes and the weekend ride gives the total time spent biking in a week: 4 hours plus 8 hours equals 12 hours.
</think>

To determine the total time Tim spends biking in a week, let's break down his activities:

1. **Workdays:**
   - **Distance per day:** 20 miles
   - **Speed:** 25 mph
   - **Time per day:** \( \frac{20}{25} = 0.8 \) hours
   - **Total for 5 days:** \( 5 \times 0.8 = 4 \) hours

2. **Weekend Ride:**
   - **Distance:** 200 miles
   - **Speed:** 25 mph
   - **Time:** \( \frac{200}{25} = 8 \) hours

3. **Total Time Spent Biking in a Week:**

Next, I calculate the overtime pay. Tina works an additional 2 hours each day (10 total - 8 regular). The overtime rate is 1.5 times her hourly wage: 18 * 1.5 = $27.00 per hour. For 2 hours of overtime daily, she earns 27 * 2 = $54.00 per day.

Finally, I add the regular pay and overtime pay together to find her total earnings for each day: 144 + 54 = $198.00 per day.

Over five days, Tina's total earnings would be 198 * 5 = $990.00.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down Tina's earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate Regular Pay:**
   - **Hourly Rate:** \$18.00
   - **Regular Hours per Day:** 8 hours
   - **Regular Pay per Day:** 
     \[
     18 \text{ hours} \times 8 = \$144.00
     \]

2. **Calculate Overtime Pay:**
   - **Overtime Rate:** Hourly wage + half of hourly wage = \(18 + 9 = 27\) dollars per hour
   - **Additional Hours per Day:** 10 total hours - 8 regular hours = 2 hours
   - **Overtime Pay per Day:** 
     \[
     27 \text{ hours} \times 2 = \$54.00
     \]

3. **Total Earnings per Day:**
   \[
   \$144.00 (\text{Regular}) + \$54.00 (\text{Overtime}) = \$198.00 \text{ per day}
   \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings for 5 Days:**
   \[
   \$198.00 \times 5 = \$990.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

=== Problem 89 ===
Prompt:
Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?
Response:
<think>
First, I need to determine how much money Tobias has saved over the past three months.

He receives a \$5 allowance each month, so over three months, that's 3 × \$5 = \$15.

Next, I'll calculate his total earnings from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways. He mows 4 lawns at \$15 each, which brings in 4 × \$15 = \$60. If he shovels \( x \) driveways at \$7 each, that adds up to \( 7x \).

Now, I'll consider his total savings before buying the shoes. He has his allowance and earnings from work: \$15 (allowance) + \$60 (lawn mowing) + \$7x (driveway shoveling) = \$85 + \$7x.

After purchasing the \$95 shoes, he has \$15 left in change. This means that before buying the shoes, he had \$95 - \$15 = \$80 available.

Setting up the equation: \$85 + \$7x = \$80.

Solving for \( x \), I subtract \$85 from both sides: \$7x = \$80 - \$85 = -\$5.

This doesn't make sense because the number of driveways shoveled can't be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup or calculations.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled.

### **Step 1: Calculate Total Allowance**
- **Allowance per month:** \$5
- **Number of months saved:** 3

\[
\text{Total Allowance} = 5 \times 3 = \$15
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate Earnings from Mowing Lawns**
- **Payment per lawn mowed:** \$15
- **Number of lawns mowed:** 4

\[
\text{Earnings from Lawns} = 15 \times 4 = \$60
\]

### **Step 3: Let \( x \) Represent the Number of Driveways Shoveled**
- **Payment per driveway shoveled:** \$7

\[
\text{Earnings from Driveways} = 7x
\]

### **Step 4: Calculate Total Savings Before Purchasing Shoes**
- **Total Allowance and Earnings:** \$15 (allowance) + \$60 (lawn mowing) + \( 7x \) (driveway shoveling)

\[
\text{Total Savings} = 15 + 60 + 7x = 75 + 7x
\]

### **Step 5: Subtract the Cost of Shoes and Remaining Change**
- **Cost of shoes:** \$95
- **Remaining change after purchase:** \$15

\[
\text{Total Savings Before Purchase} = \text{Cost of Shoes} + \text{Change}
\]
\[
75 + 7x = 95 + 15
\]
\[
75 + 7x = 110
\]

### **Step 6: Solve for \( x \)**
\[
7x = 110 - 75
\]
\[
7x = 35
\]
\[
x = \frac{35}{7}
\]
\[
x = 5
\]

### **Final Answer**
Tobias shoveled \(\boxed{5}\)

=== Problem 90 ===
Prompt:
Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Response:
<think>
To determine how much Weng earned from babysitting, I'll start by calculating her hourly rate. She earns $12 per hour.

Next, I'll find out the total time she spent babysitting yesterday, which is 50 minutes.

Since her payment is based on hours, I need to convert the 50-minute session into a fraction of an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is equal to 5/6 of an hour.

Finally, I'll multiply her hourly rate by the fraction of the hour she worked: $12 multiplied by 5/6 equals $10.
</think>

**Solution:**

Weng earns \$12 per hour for babysitting. She worked for **50 minutes** yesterday.

1. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   
   \[
   50 \text{ minutes} = \frac{50}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = \$12 \times \frac{5}{6} = \$10
   \]

**Answer:**  
Weng earned \boxed{\
