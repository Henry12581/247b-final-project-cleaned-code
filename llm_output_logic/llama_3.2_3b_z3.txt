=== Problem 61 ===
Prompt:
A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?
Response:
```python
# Define the variables
total_people = 847
years = 300
monster_frequency = 100

# Calculate the number of ships consumed by the monster
num_ships = total_people / (2 ** ((years - monster_frequency) // monster_frequency))

# Calculate the number of people on the first ship
people_on_first_ship = total_people / num_ships

=== Problem 63 ===
Prompt:
Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
Response:
Here is the Z3 code in Python:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define the variables
budget = 200
shirt_cost = 30
pants_cost = 46
coat_cost = 38
socks_cost = 11
belt_cost = 18
shoes_cost = Int('shoes_cost') # unknown cost

# Set up the equation based on Alexis's remaining budget
remaining_budget = budget - (shirt_cost + pants_cost + coat_cost + socks_cost + belt_cost) + shoes_cost
eq = And(remaining_budget, Eq(remaining_budget, 16))

# Solve for shoes_cost
sol = solve(eq)

print("The cost of the shoes is: ", sol[shoes_cost])
```

This code defines a variable `shoes_cost` as an integer and sets up an equation based on Alexis's remaining budget. The equation states that the sum of all costs minus the shoes cost, plus the shoes cost, equals her remaining budget. It then solves for the value of `shoes

Prompt:
Brennan was researching his school project and had to download files from the internet to his computer to use for reference. After downloading 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. How many valuable files was he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round?
Response:
Here is a Python code snippet using Z3 to solve this problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
total_files_first_round = 800
deleted_percentage_first_round = 70 / 100.0
additional_files_second_round = 400

# Calculate the number of deleted files in the first round
deleted_files_first_round = total_files_first_round * deleted_percentage_first_round

# Calculate the remaining files after deleting the first round
remaining_files_after_first_round = total_files_first_round - deleted_files_first_round

# Calculate the number of irrelevant files downloaded in the second round
irrelevant_files_second_round = additional_files_second_round * irrelevant_percentage_second_round

# Calculate the number of valuable files left after deleting the irrelevant files in the second round
valuable_files_left = remaining_files_after_first_round + (additional_files_second_round - irrelevant_files_second_round)

print("The final answer is", int(valuable_files_left))
```

This code uses Z3's `Int` type to represent integers and performs arithmetic operations on these integers. The result of the calculation is then printed out as an integer.

Please note that you need to have Z3 installed in your Python environment to run this code. You can install it using pip: `pip install z3

Response:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables
x = symbols('x')  # Price of cheddar cheese in dollars

# Calculate total cost
total_cost = 2*x + (1/2)*x + 2*x

This code uses Sympy to define a variable `x` representing the price of cheddar cheese in dollars. It then calculates the total cost by adding up the costs of all ingredients and sets up an equation where the total cost equals $20 (the amount Jasper spent). Finally, it solves for `x`, which represents the price of cheddar cheese.

Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
Response:
Here's the Z3 code to solve this problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables for the number of letters in each last name
samantha_last_name = Int('samantha_last_name')
bobbie_last_name = Int('bobbie_last_name')

# Define equations based on the problem statement
eq1 = samantha_last_name == bobbie_last_name - 3
eq2 = bobbie_last_name - 2 == 2 * jamie_last_name

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve([eq1, eq2], [samantha_last_name, bobbie_last_name])

# Print the solution for Samantha's last name
print("Number of letters in Samantha's last name:", solution[samantha_last_name])
```

This code defines three variables to represent the number of letters in each last name. It then sets up two equations based on the problem statement: one that relates Samantha's last name to Bobbie's, and another that relates Bobbie's last name (with two letters removed) to Jamie's last name. The `solve` function is used to find a solution for these variables, which is then printed out.

Note that this code assumes that there is at least one solution to the system of equations. If no solution exists, the `solve` function will return an empty list.

Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
Response:
```python
from z3 import *

# Define the variables
hourly_wage = 18
hours_per_shift = 8
overtime_rate = hourly_wage + (hourly_wage / 2)
days_worked = 5
total_hours = hours_per_shift * days_worked + (hours_per_shift - hours_per_shift) * days_worked

# Calculate the total amount earned
amount_earned = (hours_per_shift * hourly_wage) + ((hours_per_shift - hours_per_shift) * overtime_rate * days_worked)

print(amount

Prompt:
Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?
Response:
```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
total_money = 95 + 15  # Total money Tobias had before buying shoes and having change
allowance = 5 * 3      # Allowance for 3 months
mowing_lawn = 15 * 4   # Money earned from mowing lawns
shoveling_driveway = Int('shoveling_driveway')  # Number of driveways shoveled

# Create constraints
total_money == allowance + mowing_lawn + shoveling_driveway

print(shoveling_driveway)
```

This code uses the Z3 solver to find the number of driveways Tobias shoveled. The `Int` function is used to create a variable, and the `==` operator is used to
