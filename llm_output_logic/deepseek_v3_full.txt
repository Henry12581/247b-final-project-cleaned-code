=== Problem 61 ===
Prompt:
A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?
[Thought Process]


[Final Answer]
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll try to break it down to understand how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.

### Understanding the Problem

We have a deep-sea monster that surfaces every hundred years to eat a ship. Over three hundred years, it has eaten ships at three different times: at year 100, year 200, and year 300. The total number of people consumed over these three feasts is 847.

An important detail is that each new ship has twice as many people as the last one. This means the number of people on the ships is increasing exponentially over time.

Let's define:
- Let the number of people on the first ship (at year 100) be **x**.
- Then, the number of people on the second ship (at year 200) would be **2x** (twice the first).
- The number of people on the third ship (at year 300) would be **2 * (2x) = 4x** (twice the second).

### Setting Up the Equation

The total number of people eaten over the three ships is the sum of people on each ship:
First ship: x
Second ship: 2x
Third ship: 4x

Total: x + 2x + 4x = 7x

We know the total is 847 people, so:
7x = 847

### Solving for x

Now, we solve for x:
x = 847 / 7
Let's do the division:

847 divided by 7:
- 7 goes into 84 (the first two digits) 12 times (since 7 * 12 = 84), with 0 left over.
- Then bring down the 7: 7 goes into 7 exactly 1 time.
- So, 847 / 7 = 121.

Therefore, x = 121.

### Verifying the Answer

Let's check if this makes sense:
First ship: 121 people
Second ship: 2 * 121 = 242 people
Third ship: 2 * 242 = 484 people

Total: 121 + 242 + 484 = 847 people
This matches the given total, so our answer seems correct.

### Conclusion

The number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is **121**.

**Answer:** 121

=== Problem 80 ===
Prompt:
Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?
[Thought Process]


[Final Answer]
Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let \( x \) be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.**

1. **Expenses Before the Raise:**
   - She spent **40%** of her income on rent and utilities.
   - Amount spent: \( 0.40x \).

2. **Income After the Raise:**
   - Her salary increased by **\$600**.
   - New income: \( x + 600 \).

3. **Expenses After the Raise:**
   - Rent and utilities now amount to **25%** of her new income.
   - Amount spent: \( 0.25(x + 600) \).

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The actual amount spent on rent and utilities **remains the same** before and after the raise.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     0.40x = 0.25(x + 600)
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   0.40x = 0.25x + 150
   \]
   \[
   0.40x - 0.25x = 150
   \]
   \[
   0.15x = 150
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{150}{0.15}
   \]
   \[
   x = 1000
   \]

**Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars.**

=== Problem 84 ===
Prompt:
Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?
[Thought Process]


[Final Answer]
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll start by identifying the information given and then work through the relationships between the names to find out how many letters are in Samantha's last name.

### Given Information:

1. **Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey.**
   - This means Jamie's last name is "Grey."
   - Let's count the letters in "Grey":
     - G, R, E, Y → 4 letters.

2. **If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s.**
   - Jamie's last name length: 4 letters.
   - Twice the length of Jamie’s last name: 2 * 4 = 8 letters.
   - So, if Bobbie removes 2 letters from her last name, the remaining part is 8 letters.
   - Therefore, Bobbie's original last name length = 8 (after removal) + 2 (removed) = 10 letters.

3. **Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name.**
   - Bobbie's last name length: 10 letters.
   - Samantha's last name length = Bobbie's - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 letters.

### Verifying the Steps:

Let me double-check to ensure everything adds up correctly.

- Jamie Grey: "Grey" is indeed 4 letters.
- Bobbie's last name: Let's denote it as B.
  - If Bobbie removes 2 letters: B - 2.
  - This is twice Jamie's last name length: B - 2 = 2 * 4 = 8.
  - So, B = 8 + 2 = 10.
- Samantha's last name: S = B - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

Everything checks out!

### Potential Pitfalls:

Initially, one might confuse "three fewer letters" with "one-third the letters," but the wording is clear here: it's a subtraction, not a division. Also, ensuring that when Bobbie removes two letters, it's from her original last name length is crucial.

### Final Answer:

**Samantha’s last name has 7 letters.**

=== Problem 85 ===
Prompt:
The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
[Thought Process]


[Final Answer]
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### **1. Understand the Profit Sharing Ratio**
- The profit is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio **2:5**.
- This means for every **$2** Mike gets, Johnson receives **$5**.

### **2. Determine Johnson's Share**
- Johnson received **$2500**.
- According to the ratio, Johnson's share corresponds to **5 parts**.

### **3. Find the Value of One Part**
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{\text{Johnson's Share}}{5} = \frac{2500}{5} = 500
\]

### **4. Calculate Mike's Share**
- Mike's share is **2 parts**.
\[
\text{Mike's Share} = 2 \times 500 = 1000
\]

### **5. Subtract the Cost of the Shirt**
- Mike spends **$200** on a shirt.
\[
\text{Mike's Remaining Amount} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

### **Final Answer**
\[

=== Problem 89 ===
Prompt:
Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?
[Thought Process]


[Final Answer]
Let's determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled by following these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Earnings from Allowance:**
   
   Tobias receives a $5 allowance each month for 3 months.
   
   \[
   3 \text{ months} \times \$5/\text{month} = \$15
   \]

2. **Calculate Earnings from Mowing Lawns:**
   
   He mows 4 lawns at $15 per lawn.
   
   \[
   4 \text{ lawns} \times \$15/\text{lawn} = \$60
   \]

3. **Let \( d \) be the Number of Driveways Shoveled:**
   
   He earns $7 per driveway shoveled.
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings from shoveling} = 7d
   \]

4. **Total Savings Before Purchase:**
   
   Add up all his earnings:
   
   \[
   \$15 (\text{allowance}) + \$60 (\text{mowing}) + 7d (\text{shoveling}) = 75 + 7d
   \]

5. **Total Savings After Purchase:**
   
   After buying the shoes for $95, he has $15 left.
   
   \[
   \text{Total savings before purchase} = \$95 + \$15 = \$110
   \]
   
   So,
   
   \[
   75 + 7d = 110
   \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   
   \[
   7d = 110 - 75
   \]
   
   \[
   7d = 35
   \]
   
   \[
   d = \frac{35}{7} = 5
