Problem 84:
Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?

sat[jamie = 4, bobbies_last = 10, samantha_last = 7]
