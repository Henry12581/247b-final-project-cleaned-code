Problem 88:
Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?

sat[total = 990, overtime_hours = 2, days = 5, overtime_pay = 27, regular_pay = 18, regular_hours = 8, hours = 10, overtime_total = 270, regular_total = 720]
990
