Problem 85:
The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?

sat[mike_remaining = 800, shirt_cost = 200, johnson_share = 2500, mike_share = 1000, unit_share = 500]
800
