Problem 89:
Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?

sat[shoes = 95, shovel_total = 35, allowance = 5, lawn = 15, lawn_total = 60, remaining = 15, months = 3, shovel_num = 5, allowance_total = 15, lawn_num = 4, shovel = 7]
