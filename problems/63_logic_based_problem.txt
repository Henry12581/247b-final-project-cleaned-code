Problem 63:
Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?

sat[remaining = 16, socks = 11, button_up = 30, budget = 200, suit_pants = 46, shoes = 41, suit_coat = 38, belt = 18]
