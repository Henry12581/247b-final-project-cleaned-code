=== Problem 21 ===
Prompt:
I have an apple that weighs 20g and my friend has two pears. If my friend puts half of the pears in a basket in front of him and I put my apple in another basket, in total, it weighs 80 oz. Assuming equal pear weight, what is the weight in grams per pear?
Response:
```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
apple_weight = 20  # in grams
total_weight_oz = 80  # in ounces
pear_weight = Real('pear_weight')
num_pears_in_basket = Real('num_pears_in_basket')

# Convert total weight from oz to g (1 oz = 28.35g)
total_weight_g = total_weight_oz * 28.35

# Set up equation: apple + num_pears_in_basket * pear_weight = total_weight_g
eq = apple_weight + num_pears_in_basket * pear_weight - total_weight_g

# Since half of the pears are in the basket, num_pears_in_basket is half of 2 (total pears)
num_pears_in_basket = 1

# Solve for pear_weight
solution = solve(eq, pear_weight)

print(solution)
