Prompt:
I have an apple that weighs 20g and my friend has two pears. If my friend puts half of the pears in a basket in front of him and I put my apple in another basket, in total, it weighs 80 oz. Assuming equal pear weight, what is the weight in grams per pear?
Response:
```python

apple_weight_g = 20
pear_count = 2
basket_weight_oz = 80

# Define variables
pear_weight_g = Variable('pear_weight', real=True)

# Equations
# Apple weight in grams
apple_weight_g_oz = apple_weight_g * 33.814  # Convert grams to ounces
# Pear weight in grams
pear_weight_g = pear_weight_g
# Half of the pears in a basket
half_pears = pear_count / 2
# Total weight in ounces
