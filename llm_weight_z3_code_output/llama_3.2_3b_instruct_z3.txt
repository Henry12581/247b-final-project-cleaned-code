=== Problem 21 ===
Response:
Here's the Z3 code to solve this problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
apple_weight = 20 * 1000 # apple weight in grams
total_weight_oz = 80
num_pears = Int('num_pears')
pear_weight_g = Int('pear_weight_g')

# Calculate total weight of pears and apple in oz
total_weight_oz_pears = num_pears / 2 * pear_weight_g / 28.35 # convert to oz
total_weight_oz_apple = apple_weight / 453.59 # convert to oz

# Set up equation
eq = total_weight_oz_pears + total_weight_oz_apple == total_weight_oz

# Solve the equation
solution = solve([eq], [num_pears, pear_weight_g])

print("Number of pears:", solution[num_pears])
print("Weight per pear in grams:", solution[pear_weight_g])
```

This code uses Z3's `Int` function to define integer variables for the number of pears and the weight of each pear. It then sets up an equation based on the given conditions and solves it using the `solve` function.

Please note that you need to have Z3 installed in your Python environment to run this code. You can install it using pip: `pip install z3-solver`.

=== Problem 22 ===
Response:
```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
x = Int('x')  # weight of one orange in grams
w = x / 3     # weight of orange eaten by brother in grams
plate_weight = 400 + w + 200  # total weight of plate in grams
total_weight = 1100           # total weight of plate and oranges in grams

# Create a solver
s = Solver()

# Add constraints
s.add(plate_weight == total_weight)
s.add(w <= x)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = s.check()

if solution == sat:
    print("Solution found")
    result = s.model()
    print(f"One whole orange weighs {result[x]} grams")
else:
    print("No solution found")
```

=== Problem 23 ===
Response:
Here is the Z3 code in Python:
```
from z3 import *

# Define the variables
x = Int('x')  # weight of one full rod in grams

# Set up the equation based on the problem statement
eq = x + (x/2) - 2.8 * 1000  # convert kg to grams

# Solve the equation
solution = solve(eq, x)

# Print the solution
print(solution[0])
```
This code defines a single variable `x` representing the weight of one full rod in grams, sets up an equation based on the problem statement, solves for `x`, and prints the result.

```python
from z3 import *

# Define the variables
milk_volume = Real('milk_volume')
water_volume = Real('water_volume')

# Set up the constraints
milk_volume_range = 0.75 * 1.5  # Half of the bottle volume
water_volume_range = 0.25 * 1.5  # Other half of the bottle volume

# Define the weights per ml
milk_weight_per_ml = 1.03

=== Problem 25 ===
Response:
```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
jar_weight = 300  # initial weight of the jar in grams
cookies = 5       # number of cookies initially placed in the jar
total_weight = 950  # total weight after placing cookies in the jar
cookies_eaten = 2   # number of cookies eaten

# Create a solver
s = Solver()

# Define constraints
jar_weight_constraint = s.add(jar_weight == 300)
cookies_constraint = s.add(cookies * cookie_weight == total_weight - jar_weight)
cookies_eaten_constraint = s.add(cookies - cookies_eaten == cookies)

# Solve the system of constraints
result = s.check()

if result == sat:
    # Get the value of cookie weight from the model
    cookie_weight = s.model()[cookie_weight]
    print(f"The weight of one cookie is {cookie_weight} grams")
else:
    print("No solution found")
```

=== Problem 26 ===
Response:
Here's a Z3 code in Python that solves this problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
x = Int('x')  # weight of gold bar (in grams)
y = Int('y')  # weight of silver added (in grams)

# Set up equations based on the given information
eq1 = x - 150 + y == 1200  # weight after removing 150g and adding 350g
eq2 = x + y == 1400  # total weight

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

# Calculate density ratio
density_ratio = solution[x] / solution[y]

print(density_ratio)
```

This code defines two variables `x` and `y`, representing the weight of gold bar in grams and the weight of silver added in grams, respectively. It then sets up two equations based on the given information: one for the total weight after removing 150g and adding 350g, and another for the total weight.

The system of equations is solved using Z3's `solve` function, which returns a dictionary containing the values of the variables that satisfy both equations. The density ratio is then calculated by dividing the weight of gold bar (`x`) by the weight of silver added (`y`).

=== Problem 27 ===
Response:
```python
from z3 import *

# Define the weights of the car and the tires
car_weight = 820  # in kg
tire_weight = 9.8  # in kg
num_tires = 4

# Calculate the total weight of all tires
total_tire_weight = tire_weight * num_tires

# Define the measured weight on the scale
measured_weight = 859.2  # in kg

# Create a solver
s = Solver()

# Add constraints to the solver
s.add(measured_weight - car_weight == total_tire_weight)

# Check if there is a solution
if s.check() == sat:
    # Get the model (i.e., the values of the variables)
    m = s.model()
    
    # Calculate the weight of air added to each tire
    air_added_per_tire = (measured_weight - car_weight) / num_tires
    
    print("The weight of air added to each tire is", air_added_per_tire, "kg")
else:
    print("No solution found")
```

=== Problem 28 ===
Response:
Here's a Z3 Python script to solve this problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables for each bag of rice
bag1_weight = Real('bag1_weight')
bag2_weight = bag1_weight + 800/1000  # Convert grams to kilograms
bag3_weight = bag2_weight - 300/1000  # Convert grams to kilograms

# Set up the equation based on the problem statement
eq = bag1_weight + bag2_weight + bag3_weight == 2.5

# Solve the equation
solution = solve((eq,), [bag1_weight, bag2_weight, bag3_weight])

if solution:
    print("The total weight of rice is {:.2f} kg".format(solution[bag1_weight]))
else:
    print("No solution found")
```

This script defines three variables for each bag of rice and sets up an equation based on the problem statement. It then uses Z3's `solve` function to find a solution that satisfies the equation.

Note: The `/1000` is used to convert grams to kilograms, as there are 1000 grams in a kilogram.

=== Problem 29 ===
Response:
```python

# Calculate the total weight of all tools in kg
total_weight_kg = Eq(heaviest_tool_weight_kg + 4*remaining_tools_weight_kg, x)

# Convert the total weight from kg to grams
total_weight_g = x * 1000

print(total_weight_g)
```

=== Problem 30 ===
Response:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables
eggs_weight = 3 * 60  # weight of eggs in grams
flour_weight = 180   # weight of flour in grams
removed_fraction = 1/4  # fraction of mixture removed

# Calculate total weight of the batter before removal
total_weight_before_removal = eggs_weight + flour_weight

# Calculate weight of mixture removed
weight_removed = (removed_fraction * total_weight_before_removal)

# Calculate remaining weight of the batter after removal
remaining_weight = total_weight_before_removal - weight_removed

print(remaining_weight)
```

=== Problem 31 ===
Response:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables
oil_volume = symbols('oil_volume')
onion_weight = symbols('onion_weight')

# Given values
oil_density = 920  # g/l
pan_contents_volume = 750  # ml
chopped_onions_weight = 300  # g

# Convert oil volume from ml to l
oil_volume_l = pan_contents_volume / 1000

# Calculate weight of oil in the pan
oil_weight = oil_density * oil_volume_l

# Add weight of chopped onions
total_weight = Eq(oil_weight + onion_weight, symbols('total_weight'))

# Solve for total weight

print(solution[0])
```

=== Problem 32 ===
Response:
Here's the Z3 code to solve this problem:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables for weights
c = Int('c')  # Weight of one chair
t = c  # Weight of table (since they are identical)
s = c - 3   # Weight of stool

# Set up equations based on given conditions
eq1 = c + t + s == 35
eq2 = c + t - s == 32

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (c))

# Print the solution for weight of one chair
print("Weight of one chair:", solution[c])
```

This code defines three variables: `c` for the weight of a chair, `t` for the weight of a table (assuming it's identical to the chair and thus has the same weight), and `s` for the weight of a stool. The two equations represent the given conditions: when both chairs and the table are present, their total weight is 35 kg; when one chair is replaced with a stool weighing 3 kg less, the total weight becomes 32 kg.

The `solve()` function is used to find the values of `c` that satisfy both equations simultaneously. The solution for `c`, which represents the weight of one chair, is then printed out.

=== Problem 33 ===
Response:
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define variables
sugar = symbols('sugar')
salt = symbols('salt')

# Original weights
original_sugar = 3
original_salt = 2

# Used amounts
used_sugar = 0.5
used_salt = 1.25

# Calculate remaining weights
remaining_sugar = original_sugar - used_sugar
remaining_salt = original_salt - used_salt

# Calculate percentage of original weight remaining
percentage_sugar = (remaining_sugar / original_sugar) * 100
percentage_salt = (remaining_salt / original_salt) * 100

print(f"Percentage of sugar remaining: {percentage_sugar}%")
print(f"Percentage of salt remaining: {percentage_salt}%")
```

=== Problem 34 ===
Response:
Here's a Z3 Python code snippet that calculates the total remaining weight of paint:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
num_cans = 4
weight_per_can = 1.6  # kg
remaining_percentage = 0.6  # 60%

# Calculate the total initial weight of paint
total_initial_weight = num_cans * weight_per_can

# Calculate the remaining weight after painting
total_remaining_weight = total_initial_weight * remaining_percentage

print(total_remaining_weight)
```

This code defines the number of cans, the weight per can, and the percentage of paint remaining in each can. It then calculates the total initial weight of paint by multiplying the number of cans by the weight per can. Finally, it calculates the total remaining weight after painting by multiplying the total initial weight by the remaining percentage. The result is printed to the console.

Note: This code uses the `z3` library's built-in support for floating-point numbers and percentages.

=== Problem 39 ===
Response:
Here's how you can solve this problem using Z3:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define the variables
total_weight = Real('total_weight')
baker_weight = Real('baker_weight')

# Set up the equation based on the given information
eq1 = total_weight / 8 - baker_weight == 0.6

# Solve for the weight of the stored dough
stored_dough_weight = Solver()
stored_dough_weight.add(eq1)
stored_dough_weight.add(total_weight > 0) # Ensure that the total weight is positive
result = stored_dough_weight.check()

if result == sat:
    print("The final answer is", stored_dough_weight.model()[total_weight] * 1000, "grams")
else:
    print("No solution found")
```

This code defines two variables `total_weight` and `baker_weight`, sets up an equation based on the given information, solves for the weight of the stored dough, and prints out the result in grams.
