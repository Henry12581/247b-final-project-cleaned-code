=== Problem 1 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate π^{π^2}
Response:
To evaluate π^{π^2}, we need to calculate the value of π^2 first.

π ≈ 3.14159 (we'll use this approximation for calculation)

π^2 = (3.14159)^2
= 9.869604401089448

Now, let's calculate π^{π^2}:

π^{π^2} = e^(π^2 * ln(π))
where ln is the natural logarithm.

ln(π) ≈ ln(3.14159)
≈ 1.14473

π^2 * ln(π) ≈ 9.869604401089448 * 1.14473
≈ 11.28135

Now, let's calculate e^(11.28135):

e^(11.28135) ≈ 4.8573 × 10^4

So, π^{π^2} ≈ 4.8573 × 10^4

=== Problem 2 ===
Prompt:
Simplify (e^{ln 3})^2
Response:
{9})

=== Problem 3 ===
Prompt:
Estimate ∛(27π²)
Response:
To estimate ∛(27π²), we can break it down into simpler components:

∛(27π²) = ∛(27) × ∛(π²)

Since 27 is a perfect cube (3³), we know that ∛(27) = 3.

Now, let's consider the value of π. We'll use an approximate value of π ≈ 3.14.

So, ∛(π²) ≈ ∛((3.14)²)
= ∛(9.8596)
≈ 2.16 (approximately)

Now, we multiply these two values:

∛(27π²) ≈ 3 × 2.16
≈ 6.48

So, the estimated value of ∛(27π²) is approximately 6.48).

=== Problem 4 ===
Prompt:
Compute log₁₀(e^5)
Response:
log₁₀(e^5) = 5 * log₁₀(e)
             = 5 * 1 (since log₁₀(e) is approximately equal to 1)
             = 5 

(5)

=== Problem 5 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate (9/4)^(3/2)
Response:
(9/4)^(3/2) = ((9)^(1/2))^(3) / ((4)^(1/2))^(3)
= (3^3) / (2^3)
= 27 / 8
= 3.375

=== Problem 6 ===
Prompt:
Simplify (√50 + √18) / √2
Response:
(√50 + √18) / √2 

= (√(25*2) + √(9*2)) / √2 
= (5√2 + 3√2) / √2 
= (8√2) / √2 
= 8

=== Problem 7 ===
Prompt:
Find the value of (16/81)^(1/4)
Response:
(16/81)^(1/4) = ((2^4)/(3^4))^(1/4)
= (2^4 / 3^4)^(1/4)
= (2^4)^(1/4) / (3^4)^(1/4)
= 2^(4*1/4) / 3^(4*1/4)
= 2^1 / 3^1
= 2 / 3

=== Problem 8 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate π^√2
Response:
To evaluate π^√2, we need to calculate the square root of 2 and then raise π to that power.

The value of √2 is approximately 1.414.
The value of π is approximately 3.14159.

Now, let's calculate π^√2:
π^√2 ≈ 3.14159^1.414
≈ 4.8105

So, the final answer is: (4.8105))

=== Problem 9 ===
Prompt:
Check if √2 × √3 == √6
Response:
√2 × √3 = √(2 × 3) = √6

So, √2 × √3 == √6 is True.

=== Problem 10 ===
Prompt:
Simplify ln(e^{2x}) - ln(e^x) for x = 1
Response:
{ln(e^(2*1)) - ln(e^1) = ln(e^2) - ln(e^1) = ln(e^2/e^1) = ln(e^(2-1)) = ln(e^1) = 1})

Simplify and evaluate (√3 × √12)^2
Response:
(√3 × √12)^2 
= (√(3 × 12))^2 
= (√36)^2 
= 6^2 
= 36)

=== Problem 14 ===
Prompt:
Compare π^e vs e^π (True = e^π is larger)
Response:
To compare π^e and e^π, we can calculate their values.

π ≈ 3.14159
e ≈ 2.71828

π^e ≈ 3.14159^2.71828 ≈ 22.45916
e^π ≈ 2.71828^3.14159 ≈ 23.14069

Since e^π is larger than π^e, the answer is: 
{True})

=== Problem 15 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate (1/√2)^4
Response:
(1/(√2))^4 = ((1/√2) * (1/√2))^2
= (1/2)^2
= 1/4

=== Problem 16 ===
Prompt:
Compute √(49/121)
Response:
√(49/121) = √(7^2 / 11^2)
             = (7 / 11)
             = 0.6364 

However, since you asked for the final answer in a specific format, I will provide it as follows:

(0.6364)

=== Problem 17 ===
Prompt:
Rationalize 1 / (√5 - 2)
Response:
(√5 + 2) / ( (√5 - 2)(√5 + 2) ) 
= (√5 + 2) / (5 - 4)
= √5 + 2

=== Problem 18 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate 10^{log₁₀(7.5)}
Response:
{7.5}

=== Problem 19 ===
Prompt:
Simplify log₂(8) + log₂(4)
Response:
log₂(8) = log₂(2³) = 3 (since 2³ = 8)
log₂(4) = log₂(2²) = 2 (since 2² = 4)

So, log₂(8) + log₂(4) = 3 + 2 = 5

{5})

=== Problem 20 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate (27^{1/3})^2 + (16^{1/4})^3
Response:
(27^(1/3))^2 = (3^3)^(1/3)^2 
= 3^(3*(1/3)*2)
= 3^2
= 9

(16^(1/4))^3 = (2^4)^(1/4)^3 
= 2^(4*(1/4)*3)
= 2^3
= 8

So, the final answer is: 17)
