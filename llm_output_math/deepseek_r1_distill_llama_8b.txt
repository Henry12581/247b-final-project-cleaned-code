<think>
To evaluate \( \pi^{\pi^2} \), I first recognize that this expression involves exponentiation with both the base and the exponent being related to π.

I start by calculating \( \pi^2 \). Since π is approximately 3.1416, squaring it gives:
\[
\pi^2 \approx (3.1416)^2 = 9.8696
\]

Next, I need to compute \( \pi^{9.8696} \). This requires calculating π raised to the power of approximately 9.8696.

Using a calculator or computational tool, I find:
\[
\pi^{9.8696} \approx 20626.4658
\]

So, \(e^{\ln 3} = 3\).

Now, I need to square this result: \(3^2 = 9\).
</think>

To simplify \((e^{\ln 3})^2\), follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Properties of Exponents and Logarithms:**

Prompt:
Estimate ∛(27π²)
Response:
<think>
To estimate the cube root of 27 times pi squared, I start by recognizing that 27 is a perfect cube. Specifically, 3 cubed equals 27.

Next, I consider the value of pi squared. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so squaring it gives roughly 9.8696.

Multiplying 27 by 9.8696 results in approximately 266.716.

Finally, to find the cube root of 266.716, I note that 6 cubed is 216 and 7 cubed is 343. Since 266.716 falls between these two values, the cube root must be between 6 and 7. To estimate it more precisely, I can use linear interpolation or a calculator for a closer approximation.
</think>

To estimate \( \sqrt[3]{27\pi^2} \), follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the Expression:**
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{27\pi^2}
   \]

     \sqrt[3]{27\pi^2} = \sqrt[3]{3^3 \cdot \pi^2} = 3 \cdot \sqrt[3]{\pi^2}
     \]
   
3. **Approximate \( \pi \):**
   - Use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \).
   - Then:
     \[
     \pi^2 \approx (3.1416)^2 \approx 9.8696
     \]
   
4. **Calculate the Cube Root:**

Response:
<think>
To compute \( \log_{10}(e^5) \), I start by recalling the change of base formula for logarithms. The formula states that \( \log_b(a) = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b} \).

Applying this to the given expression, I can rewrite \( \log_{10}(e^5) \) as \( \frac{\ln(e^5)}{\ln(10)} \).

Next, I use the logarithmic identity \( \ln(e^x) = x \), which simplifies the numerator. This means \( \ln(e^5) = 5 \).

Now, the expression becomes \( \frac{5}{\ln(10)} \). Since \( \ln(10) \) is approximately 2.302585093, I can substitute this value into the equation.

Finally, dividing 5 by 2.302585093 gives me the numerical value of \( \log_{10}(e^5) \).

   Now, substitute the simplified numerator back into the equation:
   \[
   \log_{10}(e^5) = \frac{5}{\ln(10)}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Numerical Value:**
   
   Use the approximate value of \( \ln(10) \approx 2.302585093 \):

Prompt:
Evaluate (9/4)^(3/2)
Response:
<think>
I need to evaluate the expression \((\frac{9}{4})^{\frac{3}{2}}\).

First, I'll express 9 as \(3^2\) and 4 as \(2^2\), so the fraction becomes \(\left(\frac{3^2}{2^2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\).

Next, I'll apply the exponent to both the numerator and the denominator separately. This gives me \(\frac{(3^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}{(2^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\).

Simplifying each term, \( (3^2)^{\frac{3}{2}} = 3^{3} = 27 \) and \( (2^2)^{\frac{3}{2}} = 2^{3} = 8 \).

Finally, dividing these results gives me \(\frac{27}{8}\).
</think>

To evaluate the expression \((\frac{9}{4})^{\frac{3}{2}}\), follow these steps:

1. **Express the Numerator and Denominator as Powers of Prime Numbers:**

=== Problem 6 ===
Prompt:
Simplify (√50 + √18) / √2
Response:
<think>
To simplify \((\sqrt{50} + \sqrt{18}) / \sqrt{2}\), I will start by simplifying each square root individually.

First, for \(\sqrt{50}\), I can express 50 as \(25 \times 2\). This allows me to write \(\sqrt{50}\) as \(\sqrt{25 \times 2}\), which simplifies to \(5\sqrt{2}\).

Next, for \(\sqrt{18}\), I can express 18 as \(9 \times 2\). Therefore, \(\sqrt{18}\) becomes \(\sqrt{9 \times 2}\), simplifying to \(3\sqrt{2}\).

Now, substituting these back into the original expression, we have:
\[
\frac{5\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
Combining like terms in the numerator gives:
\[
8\sqrt{2}
\]
So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{8\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

=== Problem 7 ===
Prompt:
Find the value of (16/81)^(1/4)
Response:
<think>
To find the value of \( \left( \frac{16}{81} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \), I start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses.

First, I recognize that both 16 and 81 are perfect squares. Specifically, \( 16 = 2^4 \) and \( 81 = 3^4 \). This allows me to rewrite the fraction as \( \frac{2^4}{3^4} \).

Next, I apply the exponent of \( \frac{1}{4} \) to both the numerator and the denominator. Using the property of exponents that states \( (a/b)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n} \), I get:

\[
\left( \frac{2^4}{3^4} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{(2^4)^{\frac{1}{4}}}{(3^4)^{\frac{1}{4}}}
\]

Simplifying the exponents, \( (2^4)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{1} = 2 \) and \( (3^4)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 3^{1} = 3 \).

Finally, dividing these results gives:

\[
\frac{2}{3}
\]

So, the value of \( \left( \frac{16}{81} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

   - \( 16 = 2^4 \)
   - \( 81 = 3^4 \)

2. **Rewrite the Expression Using These Exponents:**
   
   \[
   \left( \dfrac{16}{81} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} = \left( \dfrac{2^4}{3^4} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}
   \]

3. **Apply the Exponent to Both Numerator and Denominator:**
   
   \[
   \left( 2^4 \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 2^{4 \times \frac{1}{4}} = 2^1 = 2
   \]
   
   \[
   \left( 3^4 \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 3^{4 \times \frac{1}{4}} = 3^1 = 3
   \]

4. **Divide the Results:**
   
   \[
   \dfrac{2}{3}

=== Problem 8 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate π^√2
Response:
<think>
To evaluate \( \pi^{\sqrt{2}} \), I first recognize that both π and √2 are transcendental numbers. This means they cannot be expressed as a simple fraction and their decimal representations go on indefinitely.

Next, I consider the numerical value of √2, which is approximately 1.4142. Raising π to this power involves multiplying π by itself √2 times. Given that π is roughly 3.1416, calculating \( \pi^{\sqrt{2}} \) directly would be quite complex without a calculator.

To simplify the computation, I can use logarithms. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, I have:

\[
\ln(\pi^{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \ln(\pi)
\]

Calculating \( \ln(3.1416) \), which is approximately 1.1447, and multiplying it by √2 (≈1.4142), gives:

\[
\sqrt{2} \cdot \ln(\pi) \approx 1.4142 \times 1.1447 \approx 1.621
\]

Finally, exponentiating both sides to solve for \( \pi^{\sqrt{2}} \):

\[
\pi^{\sqrt{2}} = e^{1.621} \approx 5.08
\]
</think>

To evaluate \( \pi^{\sqrt{2}} \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Values:**
   - \( \pi \) is approximately \( 3.1416 \).
   - \( \sqrt{2} \) is approximately \( 1.4142 \).

2. **Calculate Using Logarithms:**
   
   To simplify the exponentiation, we can use logarithms.

   \[
   \ln(\pi^{\sqrt{2}}) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \ln(\pi)
   \]

3. **Compute the Natural Logarithm of \( \pi \):**

   \[
   \ln(3.1416) \approx 1.1447
   \]

4. **Multiply by \( \sqrt{2} \):**

   \[
   \sqrt{2} \cdot 1.1447 \approx 1.4142 \times 1.1447 \approx 1.621
   \]

5. **Exponentiate to Find \( \pi^{\sqrt{2}} \):**

   \[
   \pi^{\sqrt{2}} = e^{1.621} \approx 5.08
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{5.08}

=== Problem 9 ===
Prompt:
Check if √2 × √3 == √6
Response:
<think>
To determine whether √2 multiplied by √3 equals √6, I can use the properties of square roots.

First, I know that √a × √b = √(a × b). Applying this property to √2 and √3 gives:

√2 × √3 = √(2 × 3) = √6

Therefore, √2 × √3 indeed equals √6.
</think>

To determine whether \( \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{3} \) is equal to \( \sqrt{6} \), we can use the property of square roots that states:

\[
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \times b}
\]

Applying this property to our numbers:

\[
\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{2 \times 3} = \sqrt{6}
\]

Therefore, the equality holds true.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{\sqrt{6}}

=== Problem 10 ===
Prompt:
Simplify ln(e^{2x}) - ln(e^x) for x = 1
Response:
<think>
Okay, so I have this problem to simplify ln(e^{2x}) minus ln(e^x) when x is equal to 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First off, I remember that the natural logarithm function, ln, and the exponential function e are inverses of each other. That means ln(e^y) should simplify nicely because they cancel out. Let me write down what I know:

ln(e^{2x}) - ln(e^x)

I think I can use the property of logarithms that says ln(a^b) = b*ln(a). So applying that to both terms, let's see.

Starting with ln(e^{2x}), using the property, this becomes 2x * ln(e). But wait, since ln(e) is just 1 because e is the base of the natural logarithm. So that simplifies to 2x*1 = 2x.

Similarly, for the second term, ln(e^x), applying the same property gives x * ln(e), which again is x*1 = x.

So now my expression becomes:

2x - x

Which simplifies further to just x. So after simplifying both logarithmic terms, I'm left with x.

But wait, the problem specifies that x = 1. So plugging in x = 1 into this simplified expression gives me 1*1 = 1.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from ln(e^{2x}) - ln(e^x), using the logarithm power rule correctly, which reduces each term by multiplying the exponent with ln(e). Since ln(e) is indeed 1, that part checks out. Subtracting x from 2x gives me x, and substituting x=1 gives 1.

I think that's correct. So the final answer should be 1.
</think>

The expression simplifies to \( x \), so when \( x = 1 \), the result is 1.

=== Problem 11 ===
Prompt:
Find the value of (2^{log₂5})^3
Response:
<think>
First, I recognize that \( 2^{\log_2 5} \) simplifies to 5 because any number raised to the logarithm with the same base returns the original number.

Next, I need to raise this result to the power of 3. So, \( 5^3 = 125 \).

Therefore, the value of \( (2^{\log_2 5})^3 \) is 125.
</think>

To find the value of \( \left(2^{\log_2 5}\right)^3 \), follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the Inner Expression:**
   
   First, evaluate \( 2^{\log_2 5} \).

   \[
   2^{\log_2 5} = 5
   \]
   
   This is because \( a^{\log_a b} = b \) for any positive real number \( b \) and base \( a > 1 \).

2. **Raise the Result to the Power of 3:**
   
   Now, raise the simplified expression to the power of 3.

   \[
   \left(5\right)^3 = 125
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   Therefore,

   \[
   \boxed{125}

=== Problem 14 ===
Prompt:
Compare π^e vs e^π (True = e^π is larger)
Response:
<think>
To compare \( \pi^{e} \) and \( e^{\pi} \), I can use logarithms to simplify the expressions.

First, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(\pi^{e}) = e \cdot \ln(\pi)
\]
\[
\ln(e^{\pi}) = \pi
\]

Next, compare \( e \cdot \ln(\pi) \) with \( \pi \). Since \( e \approx 2.718 \) and \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \), we can calculate:
\[
e \cdot \ln(3.1416) \approx 2.718 \times 1.1447 \approx 3.110
\]
\[
\pi \approx 3.1416
\]

Since \( 3.110 < 3.1416 \), it follows that:
\[
e \cdot \ln(\pi) < \pi
\]
Therefore, \( \pi^{e} < e^{\pi} \).

So, the correct answer is True.
</think>

To determine whether \( \pi^{e} \) or \( e^{\pi} \) is larger, we can compare their natural logarithms. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Take the Natural Logarithm of Both Sides:**
   
   \[
   \ln(\pi^{e}) = e \cdot \ln(\pi)
   \]
   \[
   \ln(e^{\pi}) = \pi
   \]

2. **Compare \( e \cdot \ln(\pi) \) with \( \pi \):**
   
   - We know that:
     \[
     e \approx 2.718 \quad \text{and} \quad \pi \approx 3.1416
     \]
     
   - Calculate \( e \cdot \ln(\pi) \):
     
     \[
     \ln(3.1416) \approx 1.1447
     \]
     \[
     e \cdot 1.1447 \approx 2.718 \times 1.1447 \approx 3.110
     \]
     
   - Compare with \( \pi \):
     
     \[
     3.110 < 3.1416
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   
   Since \( e \cdot \ln(\pi) < \pi \), it follows that:
   
   \[
   \pi^{e} < e^{\pi}
   \]
   
   Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{True}

Prompt:
Evaluate (1/√2)^4
Response:
<think>
First, I recognize that \((\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^4\) involves raising a fraction to the fourth power.

I can simplify the expression by first squaring \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), which gives me \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Next, I square this result: \((\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4}\).

Therefore, the final answer is \(\frac{1}{4}\).
</think>

To evaluate \(\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^4\), follow these steps:

1. **Square the fraction:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1^2}{(\sqrt{2})^2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

2. **Square the result from step 1:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1^2}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}

Prompt:
Compute √(49/121)
Response:
<think>
First, I need to compute the square root of the fraction 49 over 121.

I'll start by finding the square roots of both the numerator and the denominator separately.

The square root of 49 is 7, and the square root of 121 is 11.

Now, I can rewrite the expression as √(49)/√(121), which simplifies to 7/11.
</think>

To compute \(\sqrt{\frac{49}{121}}\), follow these steps:

1. **Find the square roots of the numerator and the denominator:**
   - \(\sqrt{49} = 7\)
   - \(\sqrt{121} = 11\)

2. **Rewrite the expression using the square roots:**
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{49}{121}} = \frac{\sqrt{49}}{\sqrt{121}} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]

3. **Simplify if necessary:**
   - The fraction \(\frac{7}{11}\) is already in its simplest form.

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{7}{11}}
\]

=== Problem 17 ===
Prompt:
Rationalize 1 / (√5 - 2)
Response:
<think>
To rationalize the expression \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} - 2} \), I need to eliminate the square root from the denominator.

I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \( \sqrt{5} + 2 \).

This gives me:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{5} - 2} \times \frac{\sqrt{5} + 2}{\sqrt{5} + 2}
\]

Multiplying out the denominators using the difference of squares formula, I get:
\[
(\sqrt{5})^2 - (2)^2 = 5 - 4 = 1
\]

So the denominator simplifies to 1.

Now, multiplying the numerators:
\[
1 \times (\sqrt{5} + 2) = \sqrt{5} + 2
\]

Putting it all together, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{5} + 2}{1} = \sqrt{5} + 2
\]
</think>

To rationalize the expression \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} - 2} \), follow these steps:

1. **Multiply by the Conjugate:**
   
   To eliminate the square root from the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \( \sqrt{5} + 2 \).

   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} - 2} \times \frac{\sqrt{5} + 2}{\sqrt{5} + 2}
   \]

2. **Simplify the Denominator:**
   
   Use the difference of squares formula to simplify the denominator.

   \[
   (\sqrt{5})^2 - (2)^2 = 5 - 4 = 1
   \]

3. **Multiply the Numerators:**
   
   Multiply the numerators together.

   \[
   1 \times (\sqrt{5} + 2) = \sqrt{5} + 2
   \]

4. **Write the Final Answer:**
   
   Place the simplified numerator over the simplified denominator.

   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{5} + 2}{1} = \boxed{\sqrt{5} + 2}
   \]

=== Problem 18 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate 10^{log₁₀(7.5)}
Response:
<think>
I need to evaluate \(10^{\log_{10}(7.5)}\).

First, I recall that \(a^{\log_a(b)} = b\). This means that raising 10 to the power of \(\log_{10}(7.5)\) will simply give me 7.5.

Therefore, the value of \(10^{\log_{10}(7.5)}\) is 7.5.
</think>

To evaluate \(10^{\log_{10}(7.5)}\), follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Property:**
   
   Recall that for any positive real number \(a\) and any logarithm base \(b\), the following property holds:
   \[
   b^{\log_b(a)} = a
   \]
   
2. **Apply the Property:**
   
   In this case, \(b = 10\) and \(a = 7.5\). Applying the property:
   \[
   10^{\log_{10}(7.5)} = 7.5
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{7.5}
   \]

=== Problem 19 ===
Prompt:
Simplify log₂(8) + log₂(4)
Response:
<think>
I need to simplify the expression log base 2 of 8 plus log base 2 of 4.

First, I'll evaluate each logarithm separately. Log base 2 of 8 is equal to 3 because 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.

Next, log base 2 of 4 is equal to 2 because 2 squared equals 4.

Finally, I'll add these two results together: 3 plus 2 equals 5.
</think>

To simplify \( \log_{2}(8) + \log_{2}(4) \), follow these steps:

1. **Evaluate Each Logarithm Separately:**
   
   - \( \log_{2}(8) = x \) means that \( 2^{x} = 8 \).
     - Since \( 2^{3} = 8 \), it follows that \( x = 3 \).
     
   - \( \log_{2}(4) = y \) means that \( 2^{y} = 4 \).
     - Since \( 2^{2} = 4 \), it follows that \( y = 2 \).

2. **Add the Results:**
   
   \[
   \log_{2}(8) + \log_{2}(4) = 3 + 2 = 5
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{5}

Prompt:
Evaluate (27^{1/3})^2 + (16^{1/4})^3
Response:
<think>
First, I need to evaluate the expression \((27^{1/3})^2 + (16^{1/4})^3\).

Starting with \(27^{1/3}\), since \(3^3 = 27\), taking the cube root of 27 gives me 3.

Next, squaring this result: \(3^2 = 9\).

Moving on to \(16^{1/4}\), because \(2^4 = 16\), the fourth root of 16 is 2.

Then, cubing this value: \(2^3 = 8\).

Finally, adding the two results together: \(9 + 8 = 17\).
</think>

To evaluate the expression \((27^{1/3})^2 + (16^{1/4})^3\), follow these steps:

1. **Evaluate \(27^{1/3}\):**
   
   - The cube root of 27 is 3 because \(3^3 = 27\).
   
   \[
   27^{1/3} = 3
   \]

2. **Square the result:**
   
   \[
   (27^{1/3})^2 = 3^2 = 9
   \]

3. **Evaluate \(16^{1/4}\):**
   
   - The fourth root of 16 is 2 because \(2^4 = 16\).
   
   \[
   16^{1/4} = 2
   \]

4. **Cube the result:**
   
   \[
   (16^{1/4})^3 = 2^3 = 8
   \]

5. **Add the two results together:**
   
   \[
   9 + 8 = 17
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{17}
