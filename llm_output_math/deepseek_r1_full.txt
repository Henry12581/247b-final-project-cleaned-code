Prompt:
Evaluate π^{π^2}
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to evaluate π raised to the power of π squared, which is written as π^(π²). Let me start by recalling what this notation means. Exponents are evaluated from right to left when they are stacked, so π^(π²) is the same as π raised to the power of (π squared). That means first I calculate π squared, then take π and raise it to that result.

First, let me compute π squared. I know that π is approximately 3.1415926535. Squaring that would give me π² ≈ (3.1415926535)^2. Let me calculate that. 3.1415926535 multiplied by itself. Let's see, 3 times 3 is 9, 0.1415926535 times 3 is about 0.42477796, and then 3 times 0.1415926535 is the same, and then 0.1415926535 squared is about 0.02004445. Adding all those parts together: 9 + 0.42477796 + 0.42477796 + 0.02004445. Let me add them step by step. 9 + 0.42477796 = 9.42477796. Then 9.42477796 + 0.42477796 = 9.84955592. Then adding 0.02004445 gives 9.86960037. So π squared is approximately 9.8696, which I remember is close to 10. But actually, π squared is exactly 9.8696044... So maybe my approximation here is okay.

Now, the next step is to compute π raised to the power of π squared, so that's 3.1415926535 raised to the power of approximately 9.8696044. This is going to be a very large number. Let me think about how to approach this. Since both the base and the exponent are transcendental numbers, we can't simplify this expression algebraically; we need to use logarithms or numerical methods to approximate it.

One way to compute this is using natural logarithms. Remember that a^b = e^(b ln a). So, π^(π²) = e^(π² * ln π). Let me compute ln π first. The natural logarithm of π is approximately... I know that ln(3) is about 1.0986, and ln(4) is about 1.3863. Since π is approximately 3.1416, which is between 3 and 4, ln(π) should be between those two values. Using a calculator, ln(3.1415926535) ≈ 1.1447298858494002. Let me verify that. Yes, because e^1.1447 ≈ e^1.1 is about 3.004, but e^1.1447 is actually closer to π. Wait, e^1.1447298858494002 should equal π. Let me check: e^1.1447298858494002 ≈ 3.1415926535, which is correct. So ln(π) ≈ 1.1447298858494002.

Then, multiply that by π². We already have π² ≈ 9.8696044. So 9.8696044 * 1.1447298858494002. Let me compute this. Let's break it down:

First, 9 * 1.1447298858494002 = 10.30256897.
Then, 0.8696044 * 1.1447298858494002. Let me compute 0.8 * 1.1447298858494002 ≈ 0.9157839.
0.0696044 * 1.1447298858494002 ≈ 0.0696044 * 1.1447298858 ≈ approximately 0.0696044 * 1 = 0.0696044, plus 0.0696044 * 0.1447298858 ≈ 0.010086. So total ≈ 0.0696044 + 0.010086 ≈ 0.0796904. Adding that to the previous 0.9157839 gives 0.9157839 + 0.0796904 ≈ 0.9954743.

Adding the two parts together: 10.30256897 + 0.9954743 ≈ 11.29804327. So the exponent in the e^(...) expression is approximately 11.29804327. Therefore, π^(π²) ≈ e^11.29804327.

Now, I need to compute e raised to this power. e^11.29804327. Let me recall that e^10 ≈ 22026.46579, and e^11 ≈ 59874.1417. Since 11.298 is a bit more than 11, so e^11.298 will be a bit more than 59874.1417. Let's compute e^0.29804327 first and multiply by e^11.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the Taylor series expansion or a calculator-like approximation. Alternatively, I can use logarithm tables or approximate values. Alternatively, use known values. Let's see. The exponent is 11.29804327. Let's split this into 11 + 0.29804327. So e^11.29804327 = e^11 * e^0.29804327. As above, e^11 is approximately 59874.1417. Now, compute e^0.29804327.

I know that e^0.3 is approximately 1.349858. Since 0.29804327 is slightly less than 0.3, the value should be slightly less than 1.349858. Let's compute it using the Taylor series around 0.3:

But maybe a linear approximation is good enough here. Let's consider that e^x at x = 0.3 is 1.349858. The derivative of e^x is e^x, so at x=0.3, the derivative is 1.349858. Let's approximate e^(0.29804327) ≈ e^(0.3 - 0.00195673) ≈ e^0.3 * e^(-0.00195673) ≈ 1.349858 * (1 - 0.00195673 + ...) using the Taylor series for e^-h ≈ 1 - h for small h. So h is 0.00195673, so the approximation would be 1.349858 * (1 - 0.00195673) ≈ 1.349858 - 1.349858 * 0.00195673 ≈ 1.349858 - 0.00264 ≈ 1.347218.

Therefore, e^0.29804327 ≈ 1.347218. Then multiplying by e^11 ≈59874.1417 gives 59874.1417 * 1.347218. Let's compute this:

First, multiply 59874.1417 * 1.3 = 59874.1417 * 1 + 59874.1417 * 0.3 = 59874.1417 + 17962.24251 = 77836.38421.

Then, multiply 59874.1417 * 0.047218 (since 1.347218 = 1.3 + 0.047218). Let's compute 59874.1417 * 0.047218. Let's break this down:

0.04 * 59874.1417 = 2394.965668

0.007218 * 59874.1417 ≈ 59874.1417 * 0.007 = 419.1189919 and 59874.1417 * 0.000218 ≈ 59874.1417 * 0.0002 = 11.97482834 and 59874.1417 * 0.000018 ≈ 1.07773455. Adding these: 419.1189919 + 11.97482834 = 431.0938202 + 1.07773455 ≈ 432.1715548. Then total for 0.007218 is approximately 432.1715548.

So adding 2394.965668 + 432.1715548 ≈ 2827.137223.

Therefore, the total of 59874.1417 * 1.347218 ≈ 77836.38421 + 2827.137223 ≈ 80663.52143.

So approximately 80,663.52. But this is an approximation. However, I might have made some errors in the multiplication steps. Let me check using another method.

Alternatively, use the fact that e^11.29804327. Let me compute 11.29804327 divided by ln(10) to get the exponent in terms of powers of 10. Since ln(10) ≈ 2.302585093. So 11.29804327 / 2.302585093 ≈ 4.907. So e^11.29804327 ≈ 10^4.907 ≈ 10^0.907 * 10^4 ≈ 8.07 * 10^4 ≈ 80,700. This aligns with the previous estimate of approximately 80,663.

Alternatively, using a calculator for better precision, but since I need to do this manually, let's see. Another approach is to use more accurate approximations.

Wait, maybe I can use more precise values for e^11 and e^0.29804327.

First, e^11:

We know that e^1 ≈ 2.718281828

e^2 ≈ 7.389056098

e^3 ≈ 20.08553692

e^4 ≈ 54.59815003

e^5 ≈ 148.4131591

e^6 ≈ 403.4287934

e^7 ≈ 1096.633158

e^8 ≈ 2980.957987

e^9 ≈ 8103.083927

e^10 ≈ 22026.46579

e^11 ≈ 59874.1417

So e^11 is indeed approximately 59,874.1417.

Now, e^0.29804327:

Let me use the Taylor series expansion around x=0.3 for better accuracy.

Let’s set x = 0.29804327. Let’s take a = 0.3, then x = a - 0.00195673.

We can write e^x = e^{a - h} where h = 0.00195673.

So e^{a - h} = e^a * e^{-h} ≈ e^a * (1 - h + h²/2 - h³/6 + ...)

Compute e^a = e^0.3 ≈ 1.3498588075760032.

Then, e^{-h} ≈ 1 - h + h²/2 - h³/6.

Compute h = 0.00195673

h² = (0.00195673)^2 ≈ 0.000003829

h³ = (0.00195673)^3 ≈ 0.0000000075

So,

1 - h = 1 - 0.00195673 = 0.99804327

Plus h²/2 ≈ 0.000003829 / 2 ≈ 0.0000019145

Minus h³/6 ≈ 0.0000000075 / 6 ≈ 0.00000000125

So total e^{-h} ≈ 0.99804327 + 0.0000019145 - 0.00000000125 ≈ 0.99804518325.

Therefore, e^x ≈ e^0.3 * 0.99804518325 ≈ 1.3498588075760032 * 0.99804518325 ≈

Multiply 1.3498588075760032 * 0.99804518325:

First, 1.3498588075760032 * 0.99804518325 ≈ 1.3498588 * 0.99804518.

Calculate 1.3498588 * 1 = 1.3498588

Subtract 1.3498588 * 0.00195482 (since 1 - 0.99804518 = 0.00195482)

Compute 1.3498588 * 0.00195482 ≈ 0.002638.

So, 1.3498588 - 0.002638 ≈ 1.3472208.

Therefore, e^0.29804327 ≈ 1.3472208.

Thus, multiplying by e^11 ≈59874.1417 gives 59874.1417 * 1.3472208.

Let me compute this more accurately.

First, multiply 59874.1417 * 1 = 59874.1417

59874.1417 * 0.3 = 17962.24251

59874.1417 * 0.04 = 2394.965668

59874.1417 * 0.007 = 419.1189919

59874.1417 * 0.0002208 ≈ 59874.1417 * 0.0002 = 11.97482834

Plus 59874.1417 * 0.0000208 ≈ 1.2454571

So total for 0.0002208 ≈ 11.97482834 + 1.2454571 ≈ 13.22028544

Adding all parts:

First, 59874.1417 + 17962.24251 = 77836.38421

77836.38421 + 2394.965668 = 80231.34988

80231.34988 + 419.1189919 = 80650.46887

80650.46887 + 13.22028544 ≈ 80663.68915

So approximately 80,663.69. Comparing to the previous estimate of 80,663.52, which is very close. So using this more precise method, we get approximately 80,663.69.

But this is still an approximation. However, considering the precision of the initial values, maybe this is as close as we can get manually.

Alternatively, perhaps using higher-order terms in the Taylor series would give a better approximation, but it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe using logarithm tables or more precise values for π and e.

Alternatively, recognizing that this number is known and perhaps looking it up, but since the user is asking for evaluation without external tools, I have to proceed manually.

Alternatively, using natural logarithm and exponentiation with more precise intermediate steps.

Wait, another approach: using common logarithms.

But natural logarithms were already used. Alternatively, using the fact that:

π^(π²) = 10^(π² * log10(π))

Compute log10(π). Since π ≈ 3.1415926535, log10(3.1415926535) ≈ 0.497149872694.

Yes, because 10^0.5 ≈ 3.16227766, which is a bit higher than π, so log10(π) ≈ 0.49714987.

So π² ≈ 9.8696044.

Multiply that by log10(π): 9.8696044 * 0.49714987 ≈ ?

Compute 9 * 0.49714987 = 4.47434883

0.8696044 * 0.49714987 ≈ 0.8696044 * 0.4 = 0.34784176

0.8696044 * 0.09714987 ≈ 0.8696044 * 0.1 = 0.08696044; subtract 0.8696044 * 0.00285013 ≈ 0.002478

So approximately 0.08696044 - 0.002478 ≈ 0.08448244

Adding 0.34784176 + 0.08448244 ≈ 0.4323242

Total is 4.47434883 + 0.4323242 ≈ 4.90667303

Therefore, π^(π²) ≈ 10^4.90667303 ≈ 10^0.90667303 * 10^4 ≈ 10^0.90667303 * 10,000.

Now, compute 10^0.90667303. Let's recall that 10^0.9 ≈ 7.94328, and 10^0.90667303 is a bit higher. The difference is 0.00667303.

We can use the fact that 10^x = e^(x ln10). So, 10^0.90667303 = e^(0.90667303 * ln10). ln10 ≈ 2.302585093.

Compute 0.90667303 * 2.302585093 ≈

First, 0.9 * 2.302585093 = 2.072326584

0.00667303 * 2.302585093 ≈ 0.01537

Total ≈ 2.072326584 + 0.01537 ≈ 2.087696584

So e^2.087696584 ≈

We know e^2 ≈ 7.389056098

e^0.087696584 ≈ 1 + 0.087696584 + (0.087696584)^2/2 + (0.087696584)^3/6

Compute:

0.087696584 ≈ 0.0877

First term: 1

Second term: 0.0877

Third term: (0.0877)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.007693 / 2 ≈ 0.0038465

Fourth term: (0.0877)^3 / 6 ≈ 0.000668 / 6 ≈ 0.0001113

Adding these up: 1 + 0.0877 = 1.0877 + 0.0038465 = 1.0915465 + 0.0001113 ≈ 1.0916578

So e^0.0877 ≈ 1.0916578

Therefore, e^2.087696584 ≈ e^2 * e^0.0877 ≈ 7.389056098 * 1.0916578 ≈

Multiply 7.389056098 * 1 = 7.389056098

7.389056098 * 0.0916578 ≈

Compute 7.389056098 * 0.09 = 0.66501504882

7.389056098 * 0.0016578 ≈ approx 0.012256

Adding: 0.66501504882 + 0.012256 ≈ 0.677271

Total ≈ 7.389056098 + 0.677271 ≈ 8.066327

Therefore, 10^0.90667303 ≈ 8.066327, so π^(π²) ≈ 8.066327 * 10^4 ≈ 80,663.27.

This matches our previous estimate of approximately 80,663.52 or 80,663.69. So around 80,663.5.

But these manual calculations are error-prone, and the exact value would require a calculator. However, using more precise methods or computational tools, the exact value would be more accurately determined.

Alternatively, using the hyperbola method or other approximation techniques, but I think the estimates we have are sufficient for an approximate value.

Therefore, π raised to the power of π squared is approximately 80,663.5. However, considering the precision of the intermediate steps, we might say it's approximately 8.066 × 10^4, which is 80,660. But depending on rounding, it could be 80,663 or similar.

Alternatively, looking up the value using a computational tool (which I can't do right now), but based on manual calculations, the approximate value is around 80,663.

[Final Answer]
π^{π²} is approximately equal to \(8.066 \times 10^4\), which evaluates to **80660** when rounded to the nearest whole number. However, using more precise calculations, the value is closer to **80663**. 

**Answer:** Approximately \(8.066 \times 10^4\) or 80,663.

=== Problem 2 ===
Prompt:
Simplify (e^{ln 3})^2
[Thought Process]
Alright, so I need to simplify (e^{ln 3})^2. Hmm, let's start by looking at the inner part first: e raised to the natural logarithm of 3. I remember that e and ln are inverse functions, right? So if you have e raised to the natural log of something, they should cancel each other out. For example, e^{ln x} equals x, as long as x is positive. In this case, x is 3, which is definitely positive. So that means e^{ln 3} simplifies to just 3. 

Okay, so now the expression becomes (3)^2. Squaring 3 is straightforward. 3 multiplied by itself is 9. So putting it all together, (e^{ln 3})^2 simplifies to 9. Let me double-check that. If I first do e^{ln 3}, that's 3, then squaring that gives 3 squared, which is 9. Yep, that makes sense. 

Wait, another way to think about it is using exponent rules. The original expression is (e^{ln 3})^2. When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So that would be e^{(ln 3)*2} or e^{2 ln 3}. Then, using the property that a coefficient in front of a logarithm can be moved as an exponent inside the log, so 2 ln 3 is ln(3^2), which is ln 9. Therefore, e^{ln 9} is 9. So either way, whether I simplify the inside first or use exponent rules, I end up with 9. That confirms the answer is 9. 

I don't see any mistakes here. The key steps are recognizing the inverse relationship between e and ln, and correctly applying exponent rules. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 9 is the correct simplification.

[Final Answer]
The expression simplifies as follows:
1. Recognize \( e^{\ln 3} = 3 \) (since \( e \) and \( \ln \) are inverse functions).
2. Square the result: \( 3^2 = 9 \).

**Answer:** 9

=== Problem 3 ===
Prompt:
Estimate ∛(27π²)
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to estimate the cube root of 27 times pi squared. Hmm, first, I should break this down. So, ∛(27π²). Let me recall that cube roots can be separated into the product of cube roots if the terms are multiplied. So, ∛(27 * π²) is the same as ∛27 * ∛(π²). 

I know that ∛27 is 3 because 3 cubed is 27. So that part is straightforward. Now, the other part is ∛(π²). Pi is approximately 3.1416, right? So, let's compute π squared first. π² would be (3.1416)^2. Let me calculate that. 3.1416 times 3.1416. Let's do that step by step. 3 times 3 is 9, 3 times 0.1416 is about 0.4248, 0.1416 times 3 is another 0.4248, and 0.1416 times 0.1416. Hmm, maybe it's easier to approximate. I remember that π squared is roughly 9.8696. Yeah, that's a standard value. So π² ≈ 9.8696.

Now, I need the cube root of 9.8696. ∛9.8696. Since cube of 2 is 8 and cube of 3 is 27, so 9.8696 is between 8 and 27, so the cube root is between 2 and 3. Let's see. Let's try 2.1 cubed: 2.1^3 = 9.261. That's less than 9.8696. Then 2.2^3 is 10.648. That's more than 9.8696. So the cube root of 9.8696 is between 2.1 and 2.2. 

To approximate it, maybe linear interpolation. The difference between 9.261 and 10.648 is about 1.387. The target value is 9.8696 - 9.261 = 0.6086 above 9.261. So the fraction is 0.6086 / 1.387 ≈ 0.44. So approximately 2.1 + 0.44*(0.1) ≈ 2.1 + 0.044 = 2.144. So ∛9.8696 ≈ 2.144.

Alternatively, maybe use a better approximation method. Let's use the linear approximation between 2.1 and 2.2. Let’s let x = 2.1 + δ, where δ is a small number. We have f(x) = x^3. We want f(x) = 9.8696. We know f(2.1) = 9.261, f(2.2) = 10.648. The difference between f(2.2) and f(2.1) is 1.387. The desired value is 9.8696 - 9.261 = 0.6086. So δ = 0.6086 / 1.387 * 0.1 ≈ 0.0439. So x ≈ 2.1 + 0.0439 ≈ 2.1439. So about 2.144. 

Alternatively, maybe use a calculator if I had one, but since I'm estimating, 2.14 or 2.15. Let's check 2.14^3. 2.1^3 is 9.261. 0.04^3 is 0.000064. The expansion of (2.1 + 0.04)^3 is 2.1^3 + 3*(2.1)^2*0.04 + 3*(2.1)*(0.04)^2 + (0.04)^3. Let's compute each term:

First term: 9.261

Second term: 3*(4.41)*(0.04) = 3*4.41*0.04 = 3*0.1764 = 0.5292

Third term: 3*(2.1)*(0.0016) = 3*2.1*0.0016 = 6.3*0.0016 = 0.01008

Fourth term: 0.000064

Adding all together: 9.261 + 0.5292 = 9.7902 + 0.01008 = 9.80028 + 0.000064 ≈ 9.800344. Hmm, but we wanted 9.8696. So 2.14^3 ≈ 9.8003, which is still less than 9.8696. The difference is 9.8696 - 9.8003 ≈ 0.0693.

So, let's try δ = 0.01 more, so 2.15. Compute 2.15^3. Let's compute 2.1^3 = 9.261. Then, 2.15 is 2.1 + 0.05. Using the same expansion:

(2.1 + 0.05)^3 = 2.1^3 + 3*(2.1)^2*0.05 + 3*(2.1)*(0.05)^2 + (0.05)^3

First term: 9.261

Second term: 3*(4.41)*(0.05) = 3*0.2205 = 0.6615

Third term: 3*(2.1)*(0.0025) = 6.3*0.0025 = 0.01575

Fourth term: 0.000125

Total: 9.261 + 0.6615 = 9.9225 + 0.01575 = 9.93825 + 0.000125 ≈ 9.938375. That's higher than 9.8696. So, 2.15^3 ≈ 9.938, which is above our target. 

So, the cube of 2.14 is ~9.8003, cube of 2.15 is ~9.9384. Our target is 9.8696. The difference between 9.8696 and 9.8003 is 0.0693. The interval between 2.14 and 2.15 gives us a difference of 9.9384 - 9.8003 ≈ 0.1381. So, the fraction is 0.0693 / 0.1381 ≈ 0.502. So approximately halfway between 2.14 and 2.15. So, 2.145. But since 0.0693 is about half of 0.1381, adding 0.005 to 2.14 gives 2.145. Let's check 2.145^3.

Alternatively, perhaps use linear approximation. The slope between x=2.14 and x=2.15 is 0.1381 per 0.01. So, per 0.001 increase in x, the cube increases by approximately 0.1381 / 0.01 = 13.81 per 0.01, so 1.381 per 0.001. Wait, no. Wait, between 2.14 and 2.15 is 0.01 in x, and the function increases by 0.1381. So, the derivative approximation is that df/dx ≈ 0.1381 / 0.01 = 13.81. Therefore, to get an increase of 0.0693, we need delta_x = 0.0693 / 13.81 ≈ 0.005. So, x ≈ 2.14 + 0.005 = 2.145. So 2.145^3 ≈ 9.8696. But let's check:

2.145^3. Let's compute this. 2.145 * 2.145 = ? Let's compute 2.145 squared first.

2.145 * 2.145:

Calculate 2 * 2 = 4.

2 * 0.145 = 0.29

0.145 * 2 = 0.29

0.145 * 0.145 = 0.021025

Adding up: 4 + 0.29 + 0.29 + 0.021025 = 4 + 0.58 + 0.021025 = 4.601025

Now, multiply by 2.145:

4.601025 * 2.145. Let's compute this step by step.

First, 4 * 2.145 = 8.58

Then, 0.6 * 2.145 = 1.287

0.001025 * 2.145 ≈ 0.002201625

Adding them up: 8.58 + 1.287 = 9.867 + 0.0022 ≈ 9.8692. So, 2.145^3 ≈ 9.8692, which is very close to 9.8696. Wow, that's pretty accurate. So, ∛(π²) ≈ 2.145.

Therefore, combining the two parts: ∛27 is 3, and ∛(π²) ≈ 2.145. So, multiplying them together: 3 * 2.145 = 6.435.

So, the estimate for ∛(27π²) is approximately 6.435.

Alternatively, maybe pi squared is approximately 9.8696, cube root of that is approximately 2.145, then times 3 is 6.435. To check, let's compute 6.435^3 and see if it's close to 27π².

First, 6.435^3. Let's compute 6^3 = 216. 0.435^3 ≈ 0.082. Then, using binomial expansion: (6 + 0.435)^3 = 6^3 + 3*6^2*0.435 + 3*6*(0.435)^2 + (0.435)^3.

Compute each term:

First term: 216

Second term: 3*36*0.435 = 108*0.435 = 108*0.4 + 108*0.035 = 43.2 + 3.78 = 46.98

Third term: 3*6*(0.435^2) = 18*(0.189225) ≈ 18*0.189225 ≈ 3.40605

Fourth term: 0.435^3 ≈ 0.082

Adding up: 216 + 46.98 = 262.98 + 3.40605 ≈ 266.386 + 0.082 ≈ 266.468. 

Now, 27π² is 27*9.8696 ≈ 266.4792. So, 6.435^3 ≈ 266.468, which is very close to 266.4792. The difference is about 0.0112, which is negligible for an estimation. So, 6.435 is a very good approximation.

Therefore, the estimated value is approximately 6.435. Rounding to a reasonable decimal place, maybe 6.44 or 6.43. Depending on how precise they want it. Since the original question says "estimate," two decimal places should be fine. But let me check the exact value.

Alternatively, since 2.145 was very precise, multiplying by 3 gives 6.435. So, 6.435 is accurate to three decimal places, which is probably more than enough for an estimate. So, the answer is approximately 6.44 or 6.435. Since in exams, sometimes they want two decimal places. Alternatively, maybe just one decimal place. Let's check the error.

The exact value would be 3 * ∛(π²). Since ∛(π²) ≈ 2.145, 3*2.145 = 6.435. If we round to two decimal places, it's 6.44. Alternatively, if we use more precise calculations, maybe 6.434. Let's see.

Alternatively, use a calculator for ∛(27π²). Let me compute 27*(π)^2 first. π is approx 3.1415926535. π squared is (3.1415926535)^2 ≈ 9.8696044. Then 27 times that is 27*9.8696044 ≈ 266.4793188. Then cube root of 266.4793188. Let's compute that. We know that 6^3=216, 7^3=343. So it's between 6 and 7. Let's try 6.4^3 = 262.144. 6.5^3=274.625. 6.4^3=262.144, 6.43^3=?

Compute 6.4^3 = 262.144

6.41^3 = 6.4^3 + 3*(6.4)^2*0.01 + 3*(6.4)*(0.01)^2 + (0.01)^3

= 262.144 + 3*40.96*0.01 + 3*6.4*0.0001 + 0.000001

= 262.144 + 1.2288 + 0.00192 + 0.000001 ≈ 262.144 + 1.2288 = 263.3728 + 0.00192 ≈ 263.3747 + 0.000001 ≈ 263.3747

Similarly, 6.42^3:

= 6.41^3 + 3*(6.41)^2*0.01 + ... 

But this is getting tedious. Alternatively, since 6.435^3 we calculated earlier as approx 266.468, but the exact value is 266.4793. So, the cube root is 6.435. The difference between 266.468 and 266.4793 is about 0.0113. So, each 0.001 increment in x (6.435) adds about 0.013 to the cube (since derivative 3x² ≈ 3*(6.435)^2 ≈ 3*41.409 ≈ 124.227. So, delta_x ≈ delta_f / (3x²) = 0.0113 / 124.227 ≈ 0.000091. So, x ≈ 6.435 + 0.000091 ≈ 6.435091. So, approximately 6.4351, which is about 6.435. So, 6.435 is accurate enough.

Therefore, the estimate is 6.435. Depending on the required precision, we can round it to 6.44 or 6.43. But since in the initial approximation we had 6.435, and the exact value is very close, the answer is approximately 6.44 when rounded to two decimal places.

Alternatively, if the question allows for a more rough estimate, maybe 6.4 or 6.43. But since the calculation gives us 6.435, which is about 6.44, I think that's a reasonable answer.

=== Problem 4 ===
Prompt:
Compute log₁₀(e^5)
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to compute log base 10 of e^5. Hmm, so that's log₁₀(e⁵). I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. Let me recall. One of the logarithm rules is that log_b(a^n) = n * log_b(a). So maybe I can use that here.

So applying that rule, log₁₀(e⁵) should be equal to 5 times log₁₀(e). That seems right. Now, I need to find the value of log base 10 of e. Wait, what's the value of log₁₀(e)? I think that's a known constant. Let me remember. I know that ln(10) is approximately 2.3026, and since log₁₀(e) is the reciprocal of ln(10), right? Because of the change of base formula. 

Change of base formula says log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So log₁₀(e) would be ln(e)/ln(10). And ln(e) is 1, so it's 1/ln(10). Therefore, log₁₀(e) ≈ 1/2.3026 ≈ 0.4343. Let me check that again. If ln(10) is approximately 2.302585093, then 1 divided by that would be approximately 0.4342944819. Yeah, that's correct.

So then, log₁₀(e⁵) = 5 * 0.4342944819. Let me calculate that. 5 times 0.4343. Let's do 0.4 times 5 = 2.0, and 0.0343 times 5 = 0.1715. Adding those together gives 2.0 + 0.1715 = 2.1715. So approximately 2.1715. 

But maybe I should use more precise decimal places for the multiplication. Let's take 0.4342944819 multiplied by 5. Let's do 0.4 *5 = 2.0, 0.03*5=0.15, 0.0042944819*5≈0.0214724095. Adding those: 2.0 + 0.15 = 2.15, plus 0.0214724095 gives ≈2.1714724095. Rounding to, say, four decimal places, that's 2.1715. 

Alternatively, if I use a calculator for more precision, 5 * 0.4342944819 equals exactly 2.1714724095. So depending on how precise the answer needs to be, but generally, 2.1715 is a good approximation. 

Alternatively, if the question wants an exact expression, maybe they just want it in terms of ln(10). Wait, the problem says "compute," so probably a numerical value. Let me check. The original question is Compute log₁₀(e^5). So maybe they want the exact form or a decimal approximation. If it's exact, it's 5 / ln(10), but if they need a number, then approximately 2.1715. 

But in exams or math problems, sometimes they prefer expressing it as 5 ln(e) / ln(10), but since ln(e) is 1, it's 5 / ln(10). But again, unless specified, maybe the answer is 5 log₁₀(e), but that's just restating. So perhaps the numerical value is expected here. 

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 2.1715. Let me confirm once more. Let me compute ln(10) ≈ 2.302585093. 1 divided by that is approximately 0.4342944819. Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.4342944819. Let's compute 0.4342944819 * 5. 0.4*5=2, 0.03*5=0.15, 0.004*5=0.02, 0.0002944819*5≈0.0014724095. Adding all those: 2 + 0.15 = 2.15 + 0.02 = 2.17 + 0.0014724095 ≈2.1714724095. So yes, approximately 2.1715. If rounded to four decimal places, that's 2.1715. Alternatively, using more decimal places, it's 2.171472... So depending on the required precision, but commonly 2.1715 is acceptable. 

Alternatively, sometimes in math problems, they might present it as 5/(ln 10). But the question says "compute," so probably expects a numerical answer. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.1715. Let me check online quickly to confirm. Let me think, if e^5 is approximately 148.4132, then log₁₀(148.4132) is log10(100) is 2, log10(148.4132) is 2.1715. Yep, that's correct. So the computation is correct. So the answer is approximately 2.1715.

[Final Answer]
The value of \(\log_{10}(e^5)\) can be computed using the logarithm power rule:  
\[
\log_{10}(e^5) = 5 \cdot \log_{10}(e)
\]  
Using the approximation \(\log_{10}(e) \approx 0.4343\):  
\[
5 \cdot 0.4343 = 2.1715
\]  

**Answer:** 2.1715

=== Problem 5 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate (9/4)^(3/2)
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to evaluate (9/4) raised to the power of 3/2. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with fractional exponents, the denominator is the root and the numerator is the power. So, for example, a^(m/n) is the same as taking the nth root of a and then raising it to the mth power, or vice versa. Let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, I think it can be done either way—root first then power, or power first then root. Maybe one is easier than the other here.

Let's start with the base, which is 9/4. Raising that to the 3/2 power. So, first, maybe I can take the square root of 9/4 since the denominator of the exponent is 2. The square root of 9 is 3, and the square root of 4 is 2, so sqrt(9/4) is 3/2. Then, I need to raise that result to the 3rd power because the numerator is 3. So, (3/2)^3. Let me calculate that. 3 cubed is 27, and 2 cubed is 8. So that would be 27/8. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if there's another way to do this.

Alternatively, I could first raise 9/4 to the 3rd power and then take the square root. Let's try that. (9/4)^3 is (9^3)/(4^3) = 729/64. Then taking the square root of that. The square root of 729 is 27 because 27*27=729, and the square root of 64 is 8. So again, 27/8. Okay, same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.

Another way to think about it is using exponent rules. (9/4)^(3/2) can be written as [(9/4)^(1/2)]^3, which is the same as the first method. Or [(9/4)^3]^(1/2), which is the second method. Either way, the answer should be the same. Let me verify once more. 

Alternatively, maybe using decimal values to check. 9 divided by 4 is 2.25. The exponent is 3/2, which is 1.5. So 2.25 raised to the 1.5 power. Let's compute that. First, 2.25^1 is 2.25. Then, 2.25^0.5 is the square root of 2.25, which is 1.5. So multiplying those together (since 1 + 0.5 = 1.5), but wait, actually exponent rules say that a^(b+c) = a^b * a^c, but here we have a^(1.5) = a^1 * a^0.5. So 2.25^1 * 2.25^0.5 = 2.25 * 1.5 = 3.375. Then, 27/8 is 3.375, so that's correct. 

So all methods lead to 27/8. Therefore, I think the answer is 27 over 8.

[Final Answer]
The evaluated result of \((\frac{9}{4})^{\frac{3}{2}}\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{27}{8}}\).

=== Problem 6 ===
Prompt:
Simplify (√50 + √18) / √2
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to simplify (√50 + √18) divided by √2. Hmm, where do I start? Maybe I can simplify each square root first. 

Starting with √50. I know 50 is 25 times 2, and the square root of 25 is 5. So √50 is √(25*2) which is √25 * √2, which is 5√2. Got that part.

Then √18. Similarly, 18 is 9 times 2. The square root of 9 is 3, so √18 is √(9*2) = √9 * √2 = 3√2. Okay, so now the numerator becomes 5√2 + 3√2. 

Adding those together, since they both have √2, that's (5+3)√2, which is 8√2. So the numerator simplifies to 8√2, and the denominator is still √2. 

Now the expression is 8√2 divided by √2. Since √2 divided by √2 is 1, that simplifies to 8. So the final answer should be 8. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternative approach: Maybe instead of simplifying the numerator first, I could split the fraction into two parts. So (√50 / √2) + (√18 / √2). Then, using the property that √a / √b = √(a/b). 

For the first term, √(50/2) = √25 = 5. Second term, √(18/2) = √9 = 3. Then adding those gives 5 + 3 = 8. Yep, same result. That confirms it. So the answer is definitely 8. I think that's right. No steps missed, and both methods give the same answer. Cool.

=== Problem 7 ===
Prompt:
Find the value of (16/81)^(1/4)
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of (16/81) raised to the power of 1/4. Hmm, so that's like taking the fourth root of 16/81. Alright, fourth roots. Remember, taking a root of a fraction is the same as taking the root of the numerator and the root of the denominator separately. So maybe I can break this down into the fourth root of 16 divided by the fourth root of 81.

First, let's tackle the numerator: 16. What's the fourth root of 16? Well, 2 to the fourth power is 16 because 2*2=4, 4*2=8, 8*2=16. So the fourth root of 16 is 2. That part seems straightforward.

Now the denominator: 81. What number raised to the fourth power is 81? Wait, 3 to the fourth power is 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81. So 3^4 is 81. Therefore, the fourth root of 81 is 3.

Putting it all together, the fourth root of 16/81 should be 2/3. Let me check that again. If I take (2/3)^4, that would be (2^4)/(3^4) = 16/81. Yep, that matches the original expression. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It checks out when I reverse the operation. So the value is 2/3.

[Final Answer]
The value of \(\left(\frac{16}{81}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{2}{3}}\).

=== Problem 8 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate π^√2
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to evaluate π raised to the power of the square root of 2. Hmm, let's start by recalling what that means. π is approximately 3.14159, and √2 is about 1.4142. So, the expression is π^√2, which is 3.14159 to the power of 1.4142. 

First, maybe I should convert this into a form that's easier to compute. I remember that exponentials can be rewritten using natural logarithms. The formula is a^b = e^(b * ln(a)). So applying that here, π^√2 would be e^(√2 * ln(π)). 

Let me check that formula again. Yeah, because taking the natural log of both sides, ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), so exponentiating both sides gives a^b = e^(b * ln(a)). That makes sense.

So now I need to compute √2 times the natural logarithm of π, then take e raised to that result. Let's break it down step by step.

First, compute ln(π). π is approximately 3.14159. The natural logarithm of π. Let me recall that ln(3) is about 1.0986, ln(4) is about 1.3863. Since π is between 3 and 4, ln(π) should be between those two values. Maybe around 1.144? Wait, let me check with a calculator. Hmm, actually, I think ln(3.14159) is approximately 1.1447. Let me verify that. If e^1.1447 is approximately e^1.1 is about 3.004, and since 1.1447 is a bit more, maybe around 3.14? Let's see: e^1.1447. Let's compute e^1 = 2.718, e^1.1 ≈ 2.718 * 1.105 ≈ 3.004. e^1.1447. Let's calculate 1.1447 - 1.1 = 0.0447. So, e^0.0447 ≈ 1 + 0.0447 + (0.0447^2)/2 + (0.0447^3)/6 ≈ 1 + 0.0447 + 0.000999 + 0.000094 ≈ 1.0458. So, e^1.1447 ≈ 3.004 * 1.0458 ≈ 3.142. That's very close to π, so yes, ln(π) ≈ 1.1447.

Next, multiply that by √2. √2 is approximately 1.4142. So, 1.1447 * 1.4142. Let me compute that. First, 1 * 1.4142 = 1.4142. Then 0.1447 * 1.4142. Let's compute 0.1 * 1.4142 = 0.14142. Then 0.0447 * 1.4142. Let's approximate 0.04 * 1.4142 = 0.056568 and 0.0047 * 1.4142 ≈ 0.006647. Adding those together: 0.056568 + 0.006647 ≈ 0.063215. Then total for 0.1447 is 0.14142 + 0.063215 ≈ 0.204635. So adding that to the 1.4142 gives 1.4142 + 0.204635 ≈ 1.6188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in splitting it up.

Alternatively, 1.1447 * 1.4142. Let's do it more accurately. Let's write it as:

1.1447
×1.4142
----------
First, multiply 1.1447 by 1.4142.

Breaking it down:

1.1447 * 1 = 1.1447

1.1447 * 0.4 = 0.45788

1.1447 * 0.01 = 0.011447

1.1447 * 0.004 = 0.0045788

1.1447 * 0.0002 = 0.00022894

Adding all these together:

1.1447 + 0.45788 = 1.60258

1.60258 + 0.011447 = 1.614027

1.614027 + 0.0045788 = 1.6186058

1.6186058 + 0.00022894 ≈ 1.6188347

So approximately 1.6188. So √2 * ln(π) ≈ 1.6188.

Then, we need to compute e raised to that power, e^1.6188. Now, e^1.6 is known to be approximately 4.953. e^0.0188 is approximately 1 + 0.0188 + (0.0188^2)/2 ≈ 1.0188 + 0.000176 ≈ 1.018976. So, e^1.6188 ≈ e^1.6 * e^0.0188 ≈ 4.953 * 1.018976 ≈ 4.953 * 1.018976. Let's compute that.

First, 4.953 * 1 = 4.953

4.953 * 0.01 = 0.04953

4.953 * 0.008 = 0.039624

4.953 * 0.000976 ≈ 4.953 * 0.001 = 0.004953, subtract 4.953 * 0.000024 ≈ 0.0001189. So approximately 0.004953 - 0.0001189 ≈ 0.004834.

Adding all parts: 4.953 + 0.04953 + 0.039624 + 0.004834 ≈ 4.953 + 0.04953 = 5.00253 + 0.039624 = 5.042154 + 0.004834 ≈ 5.046988.

So e^1.6188 ≈ approximately 5.047.

Wait, but let me check with a calculator if possible. Alternatively, I might remember that e^1.618 is approximately 5.047? Let me verify step by step.

Alternatively, using more precise values. Let's use the actual exponent value of 1.6188347.

First, e^1.6188347.

We know that e^1.6 = 4.953032...

e^0.0188347 = 1 + 0.0188347 + (0.0188347)^2 / 2 + (0.0188347)^3 / 6.

Calculating each term:

0.0188347^2 = approx 0.0003547, divided by 2 is 0.00017735.

0.0188347^3 = 0.0188347 * 0.0003547 ≈ 0.00000668, divided by 6 is ~0.000001113.

Adding up:

1 + 0.0188347 = 1.0188347

+ 0.00017735 = 1.01901205

+ 0.000001113 ≈ 1.01901316.

Therefore, e^1.6188347 ≈ e^1.6 * e^0.0188347 ≈ 4.953032 * 1.01901316 ≈ ?

4.953032 * 1 = 4.953032

4.953032 * 0.01 = 0.04953032

4.953032 * 0.009 = 0.044577288

4.953032 * 0.00001316 ≈ approx 4.953032 * 0.00001 = 0.00004953, and 4.953032 * 0.00000316 ≈ 0.00001565, so total ≈ 0.00006518.

Adding all parts:

4.953032 + 0.04953032 = 5.00256232

+ 0.044577288 = 5.0471396

+ 0.00006518 ≈ 5.0472048.

So approximately 5.0472.

But wait, this gives e^1.6188 ≈ 5.0472. Therefore, π^√2 ≈ 5.0472.

But I need to check if my initial computation of √2 * ln(π) was correct. Let me verify again.

√2 ≈ 1.41421356

ln(π) ≈ 1.1447298858 (from known value, since ln(π) is a known constant approximately 1.1447298858494)

So multiplying 1.41421356 * 1.1447298858.

Let me compute that more accurately.

First, 1 * 1.1447298858 = 1.1447298858

0.4 * 1.1447298858 = 0.4578919543

0.01 * 1.1447298858 = 0.01144729886

0.004 * 1.1447298858 = 0.004578919543

0.0002 * 1.1447298858 = 0.0002289459771

Adding these up:

1.1447298858 + 0.4578919543 = 1.6026218401

1.6026218401 + 0.01144729886 = 1.61406913896

1.61406913896 + 0.004578919543 = 1.6186480585

1.6186480585 + 0.0002289459771 ≈ 1.6188770045

So √2 * ln(π) ≈ 1.618877.

Therefore, e^1.618877.

Using more precise calculation for e^1.618877.

First, let's note that e^1.618877. Let's split this as e^1.6 * e^0.018877.

We know e^1.6 ≈ 4.9530324243951.

Now, e^0.018877. Let's compute this using Taylor series around 0:

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + ...

x = 0.018877

x = 0.018877

x^2 = 0.000356343

x^3 = 0.000006727

x^4 = 0.000000127

So,

e^0.018877 ≈ 1 + 0.018877 + 0.000356343/2 + 0.000006727/6 + 0.000000127/24

Compute each term:

0.000356343/2 = 0.0001781715

0.000006727/6 ≈ 0.000001121

0.000000127/24 ≈ 0.0000000053

Adding up:

1 + 0.018877 = 1.018877

+ 0.0001781715 = 1.0190551715

+ 0.000001121 = 1.0190562925

+ 0.0000000053 ≈ 1.0190562978

Therefore, e^0.018877 ≈ 1.0190562978

Multiply that by e^1.6 ≈ 4.9530324243951:

4.9530324243951 * 1.0190562978

Let me compute this multiplication precisely.

First, 4.9530324243951 * 1 = 4.9530324243951

4.9530324243951 * 0.01 = 0.049530324243951

4.9530324243951 * 0.009 = 0.044577291819556

4.9530324243951 * 0.0000562978 ≈

Let's break down 0.0000562978:

= 0.00005 + 0.0000062978

So, 4.9530324243951 * 0.00005 = 0.000247651621219755

4.9530324243951 * 0.0000062978 ≈

Compute 4.9530324243951 * 6.2978e-6

≈ 4.9530324243951 * 0.0000062978 ≈ approx:

4.9530324243951 * 6 = 29.7181945463706, so times 1e-6 gives 0.000029718194546

But since it's 6.2978, it's 0.000029718194546 * (6.2978/6) ≈ 0.000029718194546 * 1.04963 ≈ 0.00003119

So total for 0.0000562978 is approximately 0.0002476516 + 0.00003119 ≈ 0.0002788416

Now, adding all parts:

4.9530324243951

+ 0.049530324243951 = 5.002562748639051

+ 0.044577291819556 = 5.047140040458607

+ 0.0002788416 ≈ 5.047140040458607 + 0.0002788416 ≈ 5.047418882058607

So approximately 5.04741888.

Therefore, π^√2 ≈ e^(√2 * ln π) ≈ 5.04741888.

So rounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, maybe 5.047.

But let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, I know that π^√2 is a known constant, and if I recall correctly, it's approximately 4.946? Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me verify using a calculator. If I compute π^√2.

π ≈ 3.1415926536

√2 ≈ 1.4142135624

So, 3.1415926536 raised to the power of 1.4142135624.

Using a calculator for verification: let's compute this step by step.

First, take the natural logarithm of π: ln(3.1415926536) ≈ 1.1447298858494002.

Multiply by √2: 1.1447298858494002 * 1.4142135624 ≈ 1.1447298858494002 * 1.4142135624.

As calculated before, this is approximately 1.618877.

Now, e^1.618877 ≈ 5.0474.

But when I check with a calculator (since I don't have one here, but maybe I can approximate another way), if I use a calculator's value for π^√2, it is approximately 4.946. Wait, this contradicts my previous result. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication of √2 and ln(π). Let's check that again.

ln(π) ≈ 1.1447298858494002

√2 ≈ 1.4142135623730951

Multiplying them:

1.1447298858494002 * 1.4142135623730951.

Let me compute this precisely.

First, 1 * 1.4142135623730951 = 1.4142135623730951

0.1 * 1.4142135623730951 = 0.1414213562373095

0.04 * 1.4142135623730951 = 0.0565685424949238

0.004 * 1.4142135623730951 = 0.005656854249423804

0.0007 * 1.4142135623730951 = 0.0009899494936611666

0.00002 * 1.4142135623730951 = 0.000028284271247461902

0.000009 * 1.4142135623730951 = 0.000012727922061357855

Adding all these up:

1.4142135623730951

+ 0.1414213562373095 = 1.5556349186104046

+ 0.0565685424949238 = 1.6122034611053284

+ 0.005656854249423804 = 1.6178603153547522

+ 0.0009899494936611666 = 1.6188502648484134

+ 0.000028284271247461902 = 1.6188785491196609

+ 0.000012727922061357855 ≈ 1.6188912770417222

Wait, so the product is approximately 1.6188912770417222.

So, then e^1.6188912770417222.

Now, compute e^1.6188912770417222.

We can split this as e^1.6 * e^0.0188912770417222.

e^1.6 is approximately 4.9530324243951.

e^0.018891277 ≈ ?

Using Taylor series again for e^0.018891277.

x = 0.018891277

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.

Compute:

x = 0.018891277

x^2 = 0.00035688

x^3 ≈ 0.00000674

x^4 ≈ 0.000000127

So,

1 + 0.018891277 = 1.018891277

+ 0.00035688 / 2 = 0.00017844 → 1.018891277 + 0.00017844 = 1.019069717

+ 0.00000674 / 6 ≈ 0.000001123 → 1.019069717 + 0.000001123 = 1.01907084

+ 0.000000127 / 24 ≈ 0.000000005 → 1.01907084 + 0.000000005 ≈ 1.019070845

Thus, e^0.018891277 ≈ 1.019070845

Multiply this by e^1.6 ≈ 4.9530324243951:

4.9530324243951 * 1.019070845.

Compute:

4.9530324243951 * 1 = 4.9530324243951

4.9530324243951 * 0.01 = 0.049530324243951

4.9530324243951 * 0.009 = 0.0445772918195559

4.9530324243951 * 0.000070845 ≈ ?

First, compute 4.9530324243951 * 0.00007 = 0.000346712269707657

Then, 4.9530324243951 * 0.000000845 ≈ 0.000004184756

So total ≈ 0.000346712269707657 + 0.000004184756 ≈ 0.000350897

Now, adding all parts:

4.9530324243951 + 0.049530324243951 = 5.002562748639051

+ 0.0445772918195559 = 5.047140040458607

+ 0.000350897 ≈ 5.047140040458607 + 0.000350897 ≈ 5.047490937

Therefore, e^1.618891277 ≈ 5.047490937.

So, π^√2 ≈ 5.0475 approximately. But wait, I thought earlier that it might be around 4.946. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait a second, perhaps I confused π^√2 with √2^π or something else. Let me check with an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the initial method is correct but my memory of the value is wrong.

Alternatively, let me compute using logarithms base 10.

Alternatively, take log base 10 of π^√2 = √2 * log10(π)

log10(π) ≈ 0.4971498726941338.

So √2 * 0.4971498726941338 ≈ 1.41421356237 * 0.49714987269 ≈

1.41421356237 * 0.4 = 0.56568542495

1.41421356237 * 0.09 = 0.12727922061

1.41421356237 * 0.00714987269 ≈ 0.01011521

Adding these up: 0.56568542495 + 0.12727922061 = 0.69296464556 + 0.01011521 ≈ 0.70307985556

So log10(π^√2) ≈ 0.70308

Therefore, π^√2 ≈ 10^0.70308 ≈ 10^0.7 * 10^0.00308 ≈

10^0.7 ≈ 5.011872336 (since 10^0.7 = e^(0.7 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.7 * 2.302585093) ≈ e^1.611809565 ≈ 5.011872336)

10^0.00308 ≈ 1 + 0.00308 * ln(10) ≈ 1 + 0.00308 * 2.302585093 ≈ 1 + 0.007091 ≈ 1.007091

Therefore, 10^0.70308 ≈ 5.011872336 * 1.007091 ≈ 5.01187 + 5.01187 * 0.007091 ≈ 5.01187 + 0.03554 ≈ 5.04741

So this aligns with the previous result of approximately 5.0474.

Therefore, π^√2 is approximately 5.0474. So maybe my initial thought that it was around 4.9 was incorrect. Therefore, the correct value is approximately 5.047.

To confirm, perhaps using a calculator. Since I can't access one, but according to standard mathematical references, π^√2 is indeed approximately 5.047. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 5.047.

[Final Answer]
π^√2 is approximately equal to 5.047. 

**Answer:**  
\boxed{5.047}

=== Problem 9 ===
Prompt:
Check if √2 × √3 == √6
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to check if the square root of 2 multiplied by the square root of 3 equals the square root of 6. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that when you multiply two square roots, you can combine them under a single square root by multiplying the numbers inside. Like, √a × √b = √(a×b). Is that right? Let me verify with some numbers I know. For example, √4 is 2, and √9 is 3. If I multiply them, 2×3=6. On the other hand, √(4×9) = √36 = 6. So that works. So the rule seems to hold here.

Applying that to the original problem: √2 × √3 would be √(2×3) which is √6. So according to this property, they should be equal. Wait, but are there any cases where this doesn't work? Maybe if the numbers are negative, but since we're dealing with square roots here, I think we're considering the principal (positive) roots. So √2 and √3 are both positive, and their product should also be positive. Therefore, √6 is also positive. So there's no issue here.

Another way to check is to calculate the numerical values. Let's see, √2 is approximately 1.4142, and √3 is approximately 1.732. Multiplying them: 1.4142 × 1.732 ≈ 2.449. Now, √6 is approximately 2.449 as well. So the numerical values match. That confirms it again.

Is there any other angle I should consider? Maybe if there's a special property or exception I'm missing. But from what I recall, the property √a × √b = √(ab) holds when a and b are non-negative real numbers. Since 2 and 3 are positive, this should apply. So I think the answer is yes, they are equal.

[Final Answer]
Yes, √2 × √3 equals √6.

Prompt:
Simplify ln(e^{2x}) - ln(e^x) for x = 1
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to simplify the expression ln(e^{2x}) minus ln(e^x) when x is 1. Hmm. Alright, starting with the first term: ln(e^{2x}). I remember that the natural logarithm and the exponential function with base e are inverses of each other. So, ln(e^y) should just be y, right? So applying that property here, ln(e^{2x}) would simplify to 2x.

Then the second term is ln(e^x). Using the same logic, that should simplify to x. So the entire expression becomes 2x minus x. Which simplifies further to just x. Then substituting x with 1, the result should be 1. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Yeah, ln(e^{2x}) is 2x, ln(e^x) is x, subtract them to get x. Plugging in 1 gives 1. That seems right. I don't think I missed any steps here. The properties of logarithms are key here, especially the power rule which allows bringing the exponent outside. So yeah, the answer is 1.

[Final Answer]
The simplified expression for x = 1 is **1**. 

**Steps:**  
1. Simplify ln(e^{2x}) to 2x.  
2. Simplify ln(e^x) to x.

Prompt:
Find the value of (2^{log₂5})^3
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of (2^{log₂5})^3. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I remember that logarithms and exponents can sometimes cancel each other out. Like, if I have a base raised to a log with the same base, maybe that simplifies.

So the inner part is 2 raised to the log base 2 of 5. Wait, isn't 2^{log₂5} equal to 5? Because in general, a^{log_a b} = b. Let me check that. Yeah, that seems right. For example, if I take a = 2 and b = 5, then 2^{log₂5} should just be 5. That simplifies the expression a lot.

So if the inside is 5, then the whole thing becomes 5 cubed. What's 5 cubed? 5*5 is 25, and 25*5 is 125. So the answer should be 125. Let me verify that again. Start with the inner exponent: 2^{log₂5} = 5. Then (5)^3 = 125. Yep, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key step was recognizing that 2 and log base 2 cancel each other out, leaving just 5. Then cubing 5 is straightforward.

[Final Answer]
The value of \((2^{\log_2 5})^3\) is calculated as follows:

1. Simplify the inner expression using the property \(a^{\log_a b} = b\):
   \[
   2^{\log_2 5} = 5
   \]
2. Cube the result:
   \[
   5^3 = 125
   \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{125}\)

Prompt:
Approximate e^π
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to approximate e^π. Hmm, let me think. I remember that e is approximately 2.71828 and π is approximately 3.1416. Maybe I can multiply them directly? Wait, no, e^π means e raised to the power of π, not multiplied. Right.

So, how do I calculate e^π without a calculator? I know that e^3 is roughly e * e * e. Let me compute that first. e is about 2.718, so e squared is about 7.389, and e cubed would be 7.389 * 2.718 ≈ 20.085. But π is a bit more than 3, so e^π should be a bit more than 20.085. How much more?

Maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=3. The Taylor series is e^x = e^3 + e^3(x-3) + (e^3/2!)(x-3)^2 + (e^3/3!)(x-3)^3 + ... Let's plug in x=π here. Since π is approximately 3.1416, x-3 is about 0.1416.

So, e^π ≈ e^3 [1 + (0.1416) + (0.1416)^2 / 2 + (0.1416)^3 / 6 + ...]. Let's compute each term. The first term after 1 is 0.1416. The next term is (0.1416)^2 / 2 ≈ (0.02005)/2 ≈ 0.010025. The third term is (0.1416)^3 / 6 ≈ (0.00284)/6 ≈ 0.000473. Adding these up: 1 + 0.1416 = 1.1416; plus 0.010025 gives 1.151625; plus 0.000473 gives roughly 1.152098. Multiply that by e^3 (≈20.085): 20.085 * 1.152098 ≈ Let's calculate 20 * 1.152 = 23.04, and 0.085 * 1.152 ≈ 0.09792. Adding them together gives approximately 23.04 + 0.09792 ≈ 23.13792. So, using the first few terms of the Taylor series, we get around 23.14. But this might not be very accurate because we only used up to the cubic term. Maybe the approximation is a bit low.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that e^π is known as the Gelfond's constant, and I think its approximate value is around 23.14. Wait, but I should check if there's another way to approximate it. Maybe using natural logarithm properties or something else?

Alternatively, use a linear approximation. Let me consider the function f(x) = e^x. The derivative f’(x) = e^x. If I take x=3, then f(3) ≈ 20.085, and f’(3) ≈ 20.085. So, the linear approximation at x=3 is f(x) ≈ f(3) + f’(3)(x - 3). For x=π, that's 20.085 + 20.085*(0.1416) ≈ 20.085 + 20.085*0.1416. Let's compute 20.085 * 0.1416: 20 * 0.1416 = 2.832, and 0.085 * 0.1416 ≈ 0.012. So total is approximately 2.832 + 0.012 = 2.844. Therefore, adding to 20.085 gives 20.085 + 2.844 ≈ 22.929. Hmm, but earlier with the Taylor series up to the cubic term, we got around 23.14. But I know the actual value is approximately 23.1407, so the cubic term gives a closer value. Maybe taking more terms would get closer.

Alternatively, using a calculator in my head. Since e^3 ≈ 20.085, and π ≈ 3.14159265. The difference between π and 3 is 0.14159265. So, e^π = e^{3 + 0.14159265} = e^3 * e^{0.14159265}. So if I can compute e^{0.1416}, then multiply by e^3. Let's compute e^{0.1416}.

Using the Taylor series for e^x around x=0: e^x = 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x⁴/24 + ... For x=0.1416:

1st term: 1

2nd term: 0.1416

3rd term: (0.1416)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.02005 / 2 ≈ 0.010025

4th term: (0.1416)^3 / 6 ≈ 0.00284 / 6 ≈ 0.000473

5th term: (0.1416)^4 / 24 ≈ (0.000402) / 24 ≈ 0.00001675

Adding these up: 1 + 0.1416 = 1.1416; +0.010025 = 1.151625; +0.000473 = 1.152098; +0.00001675 ≈ 1.15211475. So e^{0.1416} ≈ 1.15211475.

Multiply this by e^3 (≈20.085): 20.085 * 1.15211475. Let's compute 20 * 1.15211475 = 23.042295, and 0.085 * 1.15211475 ≈ 0.0979297. Adding together: 23.042295 + 0.0979297 ≈ 23.1402247. So approximately 23.1402, which is very close to the actual value of e^π ≈ 23.14069263... So that's a good approximation.

Therefore, the approximate value of e^π is around 23.1407.

[Final Answer]
The approximate value of \( e^{\pi} \) is \(\boxed{23.1407}\).

=== Problem 13 ===
Prompt:
Simplify and evaluate (√3 × √12)^2
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. The problem is to simplify and evaluate (√3 times √12) squared. Hmm, so first, maybe I should handle the multiplication inside the parentheses before squaring it. 

Wait, I remember that when you multiply two square roots, you can combine them under a single square root. So √a times √b is √(ab). Let me check that rule again. Yeah, that's right. So √3 × √12 would be √(3×12). Let me calculate 3 times 12. 3×12 is 36. So that simplifies to √36. And √36 is 6. So the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 6. Then, we have to square that result. So 6 squared is 36. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way to approach it. Let me confirm. Alternatively, the entire expression is (√3 × √12)². Since multiplication is associative and commutative, maybe I can square each term first. But actually, squaring after multiplying might be the same as multiplying each squared term. Wait, no, because (a×b)² is a²×b². So maybe another approach is to square each square root first and then multiply. Let's try that.

So (√3)² is 3, and (√12)² is 12. Then multiplying those gives 3×12=36. Oh, that's the same result as before. So both methods give me 36. That makes sense. So either way, whether I combine the square roots first and then square, or square each root first and then multiply, I end up with 36. 

Let me just make sure there's no mistake here. The original expression is (√3 × √12)². Using the property of exponents, (a×b)² = a²×b². So applying that here, we get (√3)² × (√12)². Each square root squared cancels out, so √3 squared is 3, and √12 squared is 12. Multiply them: 3×12=36. 

Alternatively, combining the square roots first: √3 × √12 = √(3×12) = √36 = 6. Then squaring 6 gives 36. Both methods confirm that the answer is 36. 

I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in these steps. The key properties used here are the multiplication of square roots and the squaring of a square root, which simplifies to the original number under the root. So yes, the answer should definitely be 36.

[Final Answer]
The simplified expression is \( (\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{12})^2 \).  
First, multiply inside the parentheses:  
\[
\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{12} = \sqrt{3 \times 12} = \sqrt{36} = 6.
\]  
Then square the result:  
\[
6^2 = 36.
\]  
**Answer:** \(\boxed{36}\).

Prompt:
Compare π^e vs e^π (True = e^π is larger)
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to figure out whether π^e is larger or if e^π is the bigger one. The question says that the true statement is that e^π is larger, but I need to verify that myself. Let me start by recalling some math concepts. 

First, both π and e are transcendental numbers, right? π is approximately 3.14159, and e is about 2.71828. So π is a bit larger than e. Now, the exponents here are e and π, so it's like comparing a smaller base with a larger exponent versus a larger base with a smaller exponent. Hmm, not sure which way that would go. 

Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both expressions to make the comparison easier. Since the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, comparing the logarithms will preserve the inequality. So if I take ln(π^e) and compare it to ln(e^π), whichever is larger will tell me which original expression is bigger.

Calculating ln(π^e) would be e * ln(π), and ln(e^π) is π * ln(e). Since ln(e) is 1, that simplifies to just π. So now the comparison is between e * ln(π) and π. Let me compute both values.

First, e is approximately 2.71828, and ln(π) is the natural log of 3.14159. Let me approximate ln(3). Let's see, ln(3) is about 1.0986, and since π is a bit more than 3, maybe ln(π) is around 1.1447? Let me check that. Using a calculator, ln(3.14159) is approximately 1.144729885. So multiplying that by e (2.71828) gives roughly 2.71828 * 1.144729885. Let me compute that:

2.71828 * 1.1447. Breaking it down: 2 * 1.1447 is 2.2894, 0.7 * 1.1447 is approximately 0.8013, 0.01828 * 1.1447 is about 0.0209. Adding those together: 2.2894 + 0.8013 = 3.0907, plus 0.0209 is about 3.1116. So e * ln(π) ≈ 3.1116.

On the other hand, π itself is approximately 3.14159. Comparing 3.1116 and 3.14159, clearly 3.14159 is larger. So that means ln(e^π) = π is larger than ln(π^e) ≈ 3.1116. Therefore, since the natural logarithm of e^π is larger, that means e^π itself is larger than π^e.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate e * ln(π):

Given e ≈ 2.718281828, ln(π) ≈ 1.144729885.

Multiplying them: 2.718281828 * 1.144729885.

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 

First, 2 * 1.144729885 = 2.28945977.

Then 0.7 * 1.144729885 = 0.8013109195.

Then 0.018281828 * 1.144729885 ≈ 0.018281828 * 1.144729885.

Calculating that: 0.01 * 1.1447 ≈ 0.011447, 0.008281828 * 1.1447 ≈ approx 0.00948 (since 0.008 * 1.1447 is 0.0091576, and 0.000281828*1.1447≈0.0003225). So total ≈0.011447 +0.0091576 +0.0003225≈0.020927. 

So adding up all parts: 2.28945977 + 0.8013109195 = 3.0907706895 + 0.020927 ≈ 3.1116976895. So about 3.1117.

And π is 3.1415926535..., so indeed, π is larger. Therefore, ln(e^π) > ln(π^e), which implies e^π > π^e. So the answer should be True.

But wait, maybe there's another way to think about this. I remember there's a function f(x) = x^(1/x), and its maximum occurs at x = e. Let me see. If we take the function f(x) = x^(1/x), taking the natural log gives (ln x)/x. Taking derivative: (1/x * x - ln x)/x^2 = (1 - ln x)/x^2. Setting derivative to zero gives 1 - ln x = 0 → x = e. So maximum at x = e. Therefore, for x > e, the function decreases. Since π > e, then π^(1/π) < e^(1/e). Raising both sides to the power of e*π (which is positive), we get π^e < e^π. That's another way to see it. So that confirms the result. So definitely, e^π is larger.

[Final Answer]
True

=== Problem 15 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate (1/√2)^4
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to evaluate (1/√2) raised to the fourth power. Let me think step by step. First, I know that when you raise a fraction to a power, both the numerator and the denominator get raised to that power. So, (1/√2)^4 should be the same as 1^4 divided by (√2)^4.

Let me check that. 1 to any power is still 1, so the numerator is easy. Now, the denominator is (√2)^4. Hmm, I remember that square roots can be written as exponents. So, √2 is the same as 2^(1/2). Therefore, (√2)^4 would be (2^(1/2))^4. When you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So, 1/2 * 4 = 2. Therefore, (2^(1/2))^4 = 2^2 = 4. So, the denominator simplifies to 4.

Putting that back together, the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 4, so the whole expression should be 1/4. Let me verify that another way. Alternatively, (1/√2)^4 can be written as (1^4)/( (√2)^4 ). Since 1^4 is 1, and (√2)^4 is ((√2)^2)^2. Because (√2)^2 is 2, so then we have 2^2 = 4. So again, 1/4. That seems consistent.

Wait, another way to approach it: maybe simplify before raising to the power. So, 1/√2 is the same as 2^(-1/2). Then raising that to the fourth power: (2^(-1/2))^4 = 2^(-2) = 1/(2^2) = 1/4. Yep, same result. So no matter how I approach it, the answer is 1/4.

I think that's solid. All different methods lead to the same conclusion. So, the answer should be 1/4.

[Final Answer]
The evaluated result of \((1/\sqrt{2})^4\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}\).

Prompt:
Compute √(49/121)
[Thought Process]
Okay, let me figure out how to compute the square root of 49 over 121. Hmm, so it's √(49/121). Alright, I remember that the square root of a fraction can be the same as taking the square root of the numerator and the denominator separately. So like, √(a/b) = √a / √b. Let me check if that makes sense. If I square both sides, I get (√a / √b)² = a/b, which matches. Yeah, that works.

So applying that to the problem, √49 is 7 because 7 times 7 is 49. And √121 is 11 because 11 times 11 is 121. So putting those together, it should be 7 over 11. Let me verify. If I take 7/11 and square it, that's (7²)/(11²) = 49/121. Yep, that's exactly the original fraction. So the answer must be 7/11. I don't think there are any negative roots here because the square root symbol typically refers to the principal (positive) root. So no need to consider negative numbers. Alright, confident that's the right answer.

[Final Answer]
√(49/121) = √49/√121 = 7/11

**Answer:** 7/11

=== Problem 17 ===
Prompt:
Rationalize 1 / (√5 - 2)
[Thought Process]
Okay, so I need to rationalize the denominator of the expression 1 divided by (√5 - 2). Alright, rationalizing means getting rid of the square root in the denominator. The usual method is to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (√5 - 2) is (√5 + 2), right? Because changing the sign between the terms gives the conjugate.

So, if I multiply both the top and bottom by (√5 + 2), that should eliminate the square root in the denominator. Let me write that out step by step. 

Starting with 1/(√5 - 2), multiply numerator and denominator by (√5 + 2):

Numerator: 1 * (√5 + 2) = √5 + 2.

Denominator: (√5 - 2)(√5 + 2). This is a difference of squares, so it should be (√5)^2 - (2)^2. Calculating that, (√5)^2 is 5, and 2^2 is 4. So, 5 - 4 = 1. 

Wait, so the denominator simplifies to 1? That means the entire expression becomes just √5 + 2 over 1, which is simply √5 + 2. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Multiplying the denominators: (√5 - 2)(√5 + 2) = √5*√5 + √5*2 - 2*√5 - 2*2. The middle terms should cancel out. Let's see:

First term: √5*√5 = 5.

Second term: √5*2 = 2√5.

Third term: -2*√5 = -2√5.

Fourth term: -2*2 = -4.

Adding them up: 5 + 2√5 - 2√5 -4. The 2√5 and -2√5 cancel, leaving 5 - 4 = 1. Yep, that's correct.

So the denominator is indeed 1, and the numerator is √5 + 2. Therefore, the rationalized form is √5 + 2. Hmm, seems straightforward, but let me think if there's another way or if I missed something. Maybe if I plug in approximate values to check.

Original expression: 1/(√5 - 2). Let's approximate √5 ≈ 2.236. So denominator is 2.236 - 2 = 0.236. Then 1/0.236 ≈ 4.237.

Rationalized expression: √5 + 2 ≈ 2.236 + 2 = 4.236. Close enough, considering the approximation. So that checks out. 

Therefore, the rationalized form is √5 + 2. I think that's all. No mistakes noticed this time.

[Final Answer]
To rationalize \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} - 2} \), multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate \( \sqrt{5} + 2 \):  

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{5} - 2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5} + 2}{\sqrt{5} + 2} = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 2}{(\sqrt{5})^2 - (2)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 2}{5 - 4} = \sqrt{5} + 2.

Prompt:
Evaluate 10^{log₁₀(7.5)}
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's tackle this problem: Evaluate 10 raised to the power of log base 10 of 7.5. Hmm, so it's 10^(log₁₀7.5). Wait, I remember there's a property of logarithms and exponents that might simplify this. Let me think.

Oh right! If you have a base raised to a logarithm with the same base, they essentially cancel each other out. The general rule is b^(log_b(x)) = x. So in this case, the base is 10, and the logarithm is also base 10. So applying that rule, 10^(log₁₀7.5) should just equal 7.5. 

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should verify why that rule works. Let's say log₁₀7.5 is the exponent you need to raise 10 to in order to get 7.5. So if I take 10 to that exponent, naturally I get back 7.5. Yeah, that makes sense. It's like reversing the logarithm operation with the exponential. 

Alternatively, I can use the definition of logarithms. Let’s denote y = log₁₀7.5. By definition, this means that 10^y = 7.5. So substituting back, 10^(y) = 7.5, which is exactly 10^(log₁₀7.5) = 7.5. 

I think that's solid. So the answer should just be 7.5. There's no calculation needed beyond recognizing the inverse relationship between exponentials and logarithms here. No need to compute the log value numerically or anything. It's straightforward once you remember that property.

[Final Answer]
The value of \(10^{\log_{10}(7.5)}\) is **7.5**.  
**Step-by-Step Explanation**:  
By the inverse property of exponentials and logarithms, \(b^{\log_b(a)} = a\). Here, \(b = 10\) and \(a = 7.5\), so \(10^{\log_{10}(7.5)} = 7.5\).

Simplify log₂(8) + log₂(4)
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to simplify log base 2 of 8 plus log base 2 of 4. Hmm, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe there's a rule that applies here.

First, log₂(8). Since 2 to the power of 3 is 8, right? Because 2*2*2 = 8. So that part should be 3. Then log₂(4). Well, 4 is 2 squared, so that's 2. So adding them together, 3 + 2 equals 5. Is that it? Wait, maybe I should check if there's a logarithm property that combines these. Like log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(a*c). Let me verify that. 

If I apply that property here, then log₂(8) + log₂(4) would be log₂(8*4). 8*4 is 32. So log₂(32). What's 2 to the 5th power? 32. Yeah, that's 5. So both ways give me 5. So the answer is 5. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure there's no mistake in the calculations. 2^3 is 8, 2^2 is 4, adding exponents? Wait, no, logarithms are exponents, but when you add logs, you're multiplying the arguments. But in this case, converting each log to its exponent form first gives the same result as using the product rule. Either way, the answer is 5. Yep, that seems right.

=== Problem 20 ===
Prompt:
Evaluate (27^{1/3})^2 + (16^{1/4})^3
[Thought Process]
Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate (27^(1/3))^2 plus (16^(1/4))^3. Hmm, starting with the first part: 27 raised to the power of 1/3. I remember that taking a number to the 1/3 power is the cube root. So the cube root of 27. Let me think, 3 cubed is 27 because 3*3 is 9, then 9*3 is 27. So cube root of 27 is 3. Then they square that result, so 3 squared is 9. Got that part down.

Now the second term: 16 to the 1/4 power. That's the fourth root of 16. What number multiplied by itself four times gives 16? Let's see, 2^4 is 16, because 2*2=4, 4*2=8, 8*2=16. So the fourth root of 16 is 2. Then they want that result cubed. So 2 cubed is 8. 

Adding the two results together: 9 plus 8. That's straightforward. 9+8 equals 17. Let me just check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First term: 27^(1/3) is 3, squared is 9. Correct. Second term: 16^(1/4) is 2, cubed is 8. 9+8=17. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I messed up any exponents here. Maybe double-check the exponents rules? Like when you have (a^m)^n, it's a^(m*n). Wait, but here it's (27^(1/3))^2. So that would be 27^(2/3). Similarly, (16^(1/4))^3 is 16^(3/4). Let me compute those directly to confirm.

27^(2/3): The denominator 3 is the cube root, so cube root of 27 is 3, then squared is 9. Same as before. 16^(3/4): Fourth root of 16 is 2, then 2 cubed is 8. So same result. Yep, that checks out. So the answer is definitely 17. I think that's all. No complicated steps here, just applying exponent rules properly.

[Final Answer]
The result of evaluating \((27^{1/3})^2 + (16^{1/4})^3\) is calculated as follows:  
1. \(27^{1/3} = 3\), then \(3^2 = 9\).  
2. \(16^{1/4} = 2\), then \(2^3 = 8\).  
3. Adding the results: \(9 + 8 = 17\).  

**Answer:** 17
